  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <!-- ********************************************************************* -->

  <div class="commentary">
    In addition to the main spec, there are lots of open ended questions,
    justification, and ideas of what best practices should be.  That random
    discussion is placed in boxes to the right side of the main text (like this
    one) to clarify what is normative and what is discussion.
  </div>
  
  
  <p>This is the language reference manual for the Swift language, which is
  highly volatile and constantly under development.  As the prototype evolves,
  this document should be kept up to date with what is actually implemented.</p>
  
  <p>The grammar and structure of the language is defined in BNF form in yellow
  boxes.  Examples are shown in gray boxes, and assume that the standard library
  is in use (unless otherwise specified).</p>
    
  <!-- ===================================================================== -->
  <h3>Basic Goals</h3>
  <!-- ===================================================================== -->

  <div class="commentary">
    A non-goal of the Swift project in general is to become some amazing
    research project.  We really want to focus on delivering a real product,
    and having the design and spec co-evolve.
  </div>
  
  <p>In no particular order, and not explained well:</p>

  <ol>
  <li>Support building great frameworks and applications, with a specific focus
    on permiting rich and powerful APIs.</li>
  <li>Get the defaults right: this reduces the barrier to entry and increases
    the odds that the right thing happens.</li>
  <li>Through our support for building great APIs, we aim to provide an
    expressive and productive language that is fun to program in.</li>
  <li>Support low-level system programming.  We should want to write compilers,
    operating system kernels, and media codecs in Swift.  This means that being
    able to obtain high performance is really quite important.</li>
  <li>Provide really great tools, like an IDE, debugger, profiling, etc.</li>
  <li>Where possible, steal great ideas instead of innovating new things that
      will work out in unpredictable ways.  It turns out that there are a lot
      of good ideas already out there.</li>
  <li>Memory safe by default: array overrun errors, uninitialized values,
      and other problems endemic to C should not occur in Swift, even if it
      means some amount of runtime overhead.  Eventually these checks will be
      disablable for people who want ultimate performance in production
      builds.</li>
  <li>Efficiently implementable with a static compiler: runtime compilation is
      great technology and Swift may eventually get a runtime optimizer, but it
      is a strong goal to be able to implement swift with just a static
      compiler.</li>
  <li>Interoperate as transparently as possible with C, Objective-C, and
      C++ without having to write an equivalent of "extern C" for every
      referenced definition.</li>
  <li>Great support for efficient by-value types.</li>
  <li>Elegant and natural syntax, aiming to be familiar and easy to transition
      to for "C" people.  Differences from the C family should only be done when
      it provides a significant win (e.g. eliminate declarator syntax).</li>
  <li>Lots of other stuff too.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>A smaller wishlist goal is to support embedded sub-languages in swift, so
     that we don't get the OpenCL-is-like-C-but-very-different-in-many-details
     problem.</p>
  
  <!-- ===================================================================== -->
  <h3>Basic Approach</h3>
  <!-- ===================================================================== -->
  
  <div class="commentary">
    Pushing as much of the language as realistic out of the compiler and into
    the library is generally good for a few reasons: 1) we end up with a smaller
    core language.  2) we force the language that is left to be highly
    expressive and extensible.  3) this highly expressive language core can then
    be used to build a lot of other great libraries, hopefully many we can't
    even anticipate at this point.
  </div>
    
  <p>The basic approach in designing and implementing the Swift prototype was to
     start at the very bottom of the stack (simple expressions and the trivial
     bits of the type system) and incrementally build things up one brick at a
     time.  There is a big focus on making things as simple as possible and
     having a clean internal core.  Where it makes sense, sugar is added on top
     to make the core more expressive for common situations.</p>
  
  <p>One major aspect that dovetails with expressivity, learnability, and focus
     on API development is that much of the language is implemented in a <a
     href="#stdlib">standard library</a> (inspired in part by the Haskell
     Standard Prelude).  This means that things like 'Int' and 'Void' are not
     part of the language itself, but are instead part of the standard library.
  </p>
  
  <!-- ********************************************************************* -->
  <h2>Phases of Translation</h2>
  <!-- ********************************************************************* -->

  <div class="commentary">
    Because Swift doesn't rely on a C-style "lexer hack" to know what is a type
    and what is a value, it is possible to fully parse a file without resolving
    import declarations.
  </div>

  <p>Swift has a strict separation between its phases of translation, and the
     compiler follows a conceptually simple design.  The phases of translation
     are:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><a href="#lexical">Lexing</a>: A translation unit is broken into tokens
    according to a (nearly, /**/ comments can be nested) regular grammar.</li>
  <li>Parsing and AST Building: The tokens are parsed according to the grammar
    set out below.  The grammar is context free and does not require any "type
    feedback" from the lexer or later stages.  During parsing, name binding for
    references to local variables and other declarations that are not at
    translation unit (and eventually namespace) scope are bound.
  </li>
  <li><a href="#namebind">Name Binding</a>: At this phase, references to
      non-local types and values are bound, and <a href="#decl-import">import
      directives</a> are both validated and searched.  Name binding can cause
      recursive compilation of modules that are referenced but not yet built.
  </li>
  <li><a href="#typecheck">Type Checking</a>: During this phase all types are
    resolved within value definitions, <a href="#expr-call">function
    application</a> and <a href="#expr-infix">binary expressions</a> are found
    and formed, and overloaded functions are resolved.</li>
  <li>Code Generation: The AST is converted the LLVM IR, optimizations are
      performed, and machine code generated.</li>
    <li>Linking: runtime libraries and referenced modules are linked in.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
  FIXME: "import swift" implicitly added as the last import in translation unit.
  </p>
  
  <!-- ********************************************************************* -->
  <h2 id="lexical">Lexical Structure</h2>
  <!-- ********************************************************************* -->
  
  <div class="commentary">
    Not all characters are "taken" in the language, this is because it is still
    growing.  As there becomes a reason to assign things into the identifier or
    punctuation bucket, we will do so as swift evolves.
  </div>
  
  <p>The lexical structure of a Swift file is very simple: the files are
     tokenized according to the following productions and categories.  As is
     usual with most languages, tokenization uses the maximal munch rule and
     whitespace separates tokens.  This means that "a b" and "ab" lex into
     different token streams and are therefore different in the grammar.</p>
  
  <!-- ===================================================================== -->
  <h3 id="whitespace">Whitespace and Comments</h3>
  <!-- ===================================================================== -->
  
  <div class="commentary">
    Nested block comments are important because we don't have the nestable
    "#if 0" hack from C to rely on.
  </div>
  <pre class="grammar">
    whitespace ::= ' '
    whitespace ::= '\n'
    whitespace ::= '\r'
    whitespace ::= '\t'
    whitespace ::= '\0'
    comment    ::= //.*[\n\r]
    comment    ::= /* .... */
  </pre>

  <p>Space, newline, tab, and the nul byte are all considered whitespace and are
     discarded, with one exception:  a '(' or '[' which does not follow a
     non-whitespace character is different kind of token (called
     <em>spaced</em>) from one which does not (called <em>unspaced</em>).
     A '(' or '[' at the beginning of a file is spaced.</p>
  
  <p>Comments may follow the BCPL style, starting with a "//" and running to the
     end of the line, or may be recursively nested /**/ style comments. Comments
     are ignored and treated as whitespace.</p>
  
  <!-- ===================================================================== -->
  <h3 id="reserved_punctuation">Reserved Punctuation Tokens</h3>
  <!-- ===================================================================== -->

  <div class="commentary">
    The difference between reserved punctuation and identifiers is that you
    can't "overload an operator" with one of these names.<br><br>
    Note that -&gt; is used for function types "() -&gt; Int", not pointer
    dereferencing.
  </div>

  <pre class="grammar">
    lparen-spaced    ::= '('      // preceded by space
    lparen-unspaced  ::= '('      // not preceded by space
    lparen-any       ::= lparen-spaced
    lparen-any       ::= lparen-unspaced

    lsquare-spaced   ::= '['      // preceded by space
    lsquare-unspaced ::= '['      // not preceded by space
    lsquare-any      ::= lsquare-spaced
    lsquare-any      ::= lsquare-unspaced

    punctuation ::= lparen-spaced
    punctuation ::= lparen-unspaced
    punctuation ::= ')'
    punctuation ::= '{'
    punctuation ::= '}'
    punctuation ::= lsquare-spaced
    punctuation ::= lsquare-unspaced
    punctuation ::= ']'
    punctuation ::= '.'
    punctuation ::= ','
    punctuation ::= ';'
    punctuation ::= ':'
    punctuation ::= '='
    punctuation ::= '-&gt;'
    punctuation ::= '...'
  </pre>

  <p>These are all reserved punctuation that are lexed into tokens.  Most other
     punctuation is matched as <a href="#identifier">identifiers</a>.
  </p>

  <!-- ===================================================================== -->
  <h3>Reserved Keywords</h3>
  <!-- ===================================================================== -->

  <div class="commentary">
    The number of keywords is reduced by pushing most functionality
    into the library (e.g. "builtin" datatypes like 'Int' and 'Bool').  This
    allows us to add new stuff to the library in the future without worrying
    about conflicting with the user's namespace.
  </div>

  <pre class="grammar">
    keyword ::= 'do'
    keyword ::= 'else'
    keyword ::= 'extension'
    keyword ::= 'if'
    keyword ::= 'import'
    keyword ::= 'in'
    keyword ::= 'for'
    keyword ::= 'func'
    keyword ::= 'oneof'
    keyword ::= 'static'
    keyword ::= 'protocol'
    keyword ::= 'return'
    keyword ::= 'struct'

  <p>string_literal tokens represent a string, and are surrounded by double
     quotes.  String literals cannot span multiple lines.</p>
  
  <p>String literals may contain embedded expressions in them (known as
  "interpolated expressions") subject to some specific lexical constraints:
  the expression may not contain a double quote ["], newline [\n], or carriage
  return [\r].  All parentheses must be balanced.</p>
  
  <p>In addition to these lexical rules, an interpolated expression must satisfy
  the <a href="#expr">expr</a> production of the general swift grammar.  This
  expression is evaluated, and passed to the constructor for the inferred type
  of the string literal.  It is concatenated onto any fixed portions of the
  string literal with a global "+" operator that is found through normal name
  lookup.</p>
  
  <pre class="example">
    // Simple string literal.

    An operator token is called <i>right-bound</i> if it is immediately
    followed by a character matching <tt>right-binder</tt>.  An operator
    token is an <tt>operator-prefix</tt> if it is right-bound but not
    left-bound, an <tt>operator-postfix</tt> if it is left-bound but
    not right-bound, and an <tt>operator-binary</tt> in either of the

  <p>'var' declarations form the backbone of value declarations in Swift. A var
  declaration takes a pattern and an optional initializer, and declares all the
  pattern-identifiers in the pattern as variables. If there is an initializer
  and the pattern is <a href="#fully_typed_types">fully-typed</a>, the
  initializer is converted to the type of the pattern. If there is an
  initializer and the pattern is not fully-typed, the type of initializer is
  computed independently of the pattern, and the type of the pattern is derived
  from the initializer. If no initializer is specified, the pattern must be
  fully-typed, and the values are default-initialized.</p>

  <p>If there is more than one pattern in a 'var' declaration, they are each
  considered independently, as if there were multiple declarations.  The
  initial attribute-list is shared between all the declared variables. 

  <p>A var declaration may contain a getter and (optionally) a setter,
which will be used when reading or writing the variable, respectively.
Such a variable does not have any associated storage. A var
declaration with a getter or setter must have a type (call it
<code>T</code>). The getter function, whose body is provided as part
of the <code>var-get</code> clause, has type <code>() -> T</code>.
Similarly, the setter function, whose body is part of the
<code>var-set</code> clause (if provided), has type <code>(T)
-> ()</code>. If the <code>var-set</code> clause contains a <code>var-set-name</code>
clause, the identifier of that clause is used as the name of the
parameter to the setter. Otherwise, the parameter name is "value".</p>

  <p>FIXME: Should the type of a pattern which isn't fully typed affect the
     type-checking of the expression (i.e. should we compute a structured
     dependent type)?</p>

  <p>Like all other declarations, var's can optionally have a list of <a
    href="#attribute-list">attributes</a> applied to them.</p>

  <p>The type of a variable must be
    <a href="#materializable"><i>materializable</i></a>. A variable is
an lvalue unless it has a <code>var-get</code> clause but not
<code>var-set</code> clause. </p>

in favor of a variable with a <code>var-get-set</code> clause if the

  <p>A function signature specifies one or more sets of parameter
    patterns, plus an optional result type.</p>

  <p>When a result type is not written, it is implicitly the empty tuple type,
    <tt>()</tt>.</p>

  <p>In the body of the function described by a particular signature,
    all the variables bound by all of the parameter patterns are in
    scope, and the function must return a value of the result type.</p>

  <p>An outermost pattern in a function signature must be <a
  href="#fully_typed_types">fully-typed</a> and irrefutable. If a result type is
  given, it must also be fully-typed.</p>

  <p>The type of a function with signature <tt>(P<sub>0</sub>)(P<sub>1</sub>)..(P<sub><i>n</i></sub>) -&gt; R</tt>
    is <tt>T<sub>0</sub> -&gt; T<sub>1</sub> -&gt; .. -&gt; T<sub><i>n</i></sub> -&gt; R</tt>,
    where <tt>T<sub><i>i</i></sub></tt> is the bottom-up type of the pattern
    <tt>P<sub><i>i</i></sub></tt>.  This is called "currying".  The
    behavior of all the intermediate functions (those which do not
    return <tt>R</tt>) is to capture their arguments, plus any
    arguments from prior patterns, and returns a function which takes
    the next set of arguments.  When the "uncurried" function is
    called (the one taking <tt>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></tt> and returning
    <tt>R</tt>), all of the arguments are then available and the
    function body is finally evaluated as normal.</p>

  <p>A function declared with a selector-style signature
    <tt>func(a<sub>0</sub>:T<sub>0</sub>) name<sub>1</sub>(a<sub>1</sub>:T<sub>1</sub>) .. name<sub><i>n</i></sub>(a<sub><i>n</i></sub>:T<sub><i>n</i></sub>) -&gt; R</tt>
    has the type <tt>(_:T<sub>0</sub>, name<sub>1</sub>:T<sub>1</sub>, .. name<sub><i>n</i></sub>:T<sub><i>n</i></sub>) -&gt; R</tt>,
    that is, the names of the fields in the argument tuple are the
    <tt>name<sub><i>n</i></sub></tt> identifiers preceding each argument
    pattern. However, in the body of a function
    described by a signature, those arguments will be bound using the
    corresponding
    <tt>a<sub><i>n</i></sub></tt> patterns inside
    the arguments. This allows for Cocoa-style keyword function
    names such as <tt>doThing(x, withThing=y)</tt> to be defined without
    requiring that an awkward keyword name be the same as the
    variable name.

    type-tuple-element ::= <a href="#type">type-annotation</a>
  </pre>

  <p>Syntactically, tuple types are simply a (possibly empty) list of
  elements enclosed in parentheses.  A tuple type with a single, anonymous,
  undefaulted element is exactly that type: the parentheses are treated as
  grouping parentheses.</p>

  <p>Tuples are the low-level form of data aggregation in Swift, and are used as
  the building block of <a href="#type-function">function</a> argument lists,
  multiple return values, <a href="#decl-oneof">oneof</a> bodies, etc. Because
  tuples are widely accessible and available everywhere in the language,
  aggregate data access and transformation is uniform and powerful.</p>

  <p>Each element of a tuple contains an optional name followed by a type and/or
  a default value expression, whose type conversion rules work like those in a
  var declaration.  The name affects swizzling of elements in the tuple when <a
  href="#typecheck_conversions">tuple conversions</a> are performed.</p>

  <p>For tuples with elements with default values, the default value is
  evaluated when converting an expression to that tuple type if it is used, or
  when a value of that tuple type is default-initialized.  The default value
  is not allowed to refer to local declarations. FIXME: Maybe we should relax
  this?</p>

  <p>If the tuple body ends with '...', the tuple is a varargs tuple. The type
     of the last element is changed from T to T[], and there are special rules
     for converting an expression to varargs tuple type.</p>

  <pre class="example">
  <i>// Variable definitions.</i>
  var a : ()
  var b : (Int, Int)
  var c : (x : (), y : Int)

  <p>Function types have a single input and single result type, separated by
     an arrow.  Because each of the types is allowed to be a tuple, we trivially
     support multiple arguments and multiple results.  "Function" types are
     more properly known as a "closure" type, because they can embody any
     context captured when the function value was formed.</p>

  <p>The result type of a function type must

  <p>Because of the grammar structure, a nested function type like 
     "(a) -&gt; (b) -&gt; c" is parsed as "(a) -&gt; ((b) -&gt; c)".  This means
     that if

    Array types are currently a hack, and only partially implemented in the

    "Int[4]" should just be sugar for array&lt;Int, 4&gt; or whatever.

    <br/><br/>Note that array types are parsed inside-out, with the first
    bounds clause being the outermost one.  This little oddity is required
    for the bounds of nested arrays to correspond in sequence to subscript
    indexes.  That is, given an array "x : Int[5][7][11][13]" and a
    chained subscript expression of the form "x[i][j][k][l]", we really
    want "i" to be bounded by 5, "j" by 7, and so on.  This is probably
    the only case where C's rule of "declaration follows use" really makes

  <p>Array types include a base type and an optional size.  Array types indicate

  <p>While they look syntactically very similar, an array type with a size has

    We intend to have a pattern-matching statement eventually, and

    The pattern grammar mirrors the expression grammar, or to be more

    algorithm for matching a value against a pattern is to try to find
    an assignment of values to variables which makes the pattern equal

  <p>A pattern has a type.  A pattern may be "fully-typed", meaning

    from their context, be it an enclosing pattern or the way it is
    used;  this set of situations is not yet fully determined.</p>

  <p>A tuple pattern is a list of zero or more patterns.  Within a

  <p>A tuple pattern is irrefutable if all its sub-patterns are

  <p>A tuple pattern is fully-typed if all its sub-patterns are
    fully-typed, in which case its type is the corresponding tuple

    label, and default value of the corresponding <tt>pattern-tuple-element</tt>.
    A <tt>pattern-tuple-element</tt> has a label if it is a named
    pattern or a type annotation of a named pattern.</p>

  <p>A tuple pattern whose body ends in <tt>'...'</tt> is a varargs tuple.
     The last element of such a tuple must be a typed pattern, and the type
     of that pattern is changed from <tt>T</tt> to <tt>T[]</tt>.  The

  <p>As a special case, a tuple pattern with one element that has no

    The ++/-- restriction is an unfortunate hack.  It happens because ++ and --
    are typically used for their side effect, not their result value.  With the
    current setup and no other solution, things like:
    "<tt>var x = foo() ++y</tt>" get parsed as a single var declaration that

  <p>All other cases are tuple literals.  The type of the expression is a tuple
     type whose elements and order match that of the initializer.  If there are

  <p>The brace statement provides a sequencing operation which evaluates the
     members of its body in order.  Function bodies and the bodies of control

  <p>The return statement sets the return value of the current <a

     return value by converting the specified expression result (or '()' if
     none is specified) to the return type of the 'func'.
  </p>
  
  <p>The stmt-return grammar is ambiguous: "{ return 4 }" could be parsed as
     {"return" "4"} or as a single statement.  Ambiguity here is resolved toward
     the first production, because control flow can't transfer to an
     subexpression.</p>

    We require braces around the body of an 'if' for two reasons: first, it

  <li>Bind to names defined in the current component, including the current

  <li>Bind to identifiers that are imported with an import directive.  Imports

  is a TypeDecl, and they have the same type, D2 is shadowed.  If a
  declaration in an imported module is shadowed by any declaration in the
  current module, it is not found by unqualified global lookup or lookup for
  members of a type.</p>

    It would be really great to have literate swift code someday, that way
    this could be generated directly from the code.  This would also be powerful
    for Swift library developers to be able to depend on being available and
    standardized.
  </div>

  <p>This describes some of the standard swift code as it is being built up.
     Since Swift is designed to give power to the library developers, much of
     what is normally considered the "language" is actually just implemented in
     the library.</p>
    
  <p>All of this code is published by the 'swift' module, which is
     implicitly imported into each translation unit, unless some sort of pragma
     in the code (attribute on an import?) is used to change or disable this
     behavior.</p>
  
  <!-- ===================================================================== -->
  <h3 id="builtin">Builtin Module</h3>
  <!-- ===================================================================== -->
  
  <p>In the initial Swift implementation, a module named <tt>Builtin</tt> is
     imported into every file.  Its declarations can only be found by <a 
    href="#expr-dot">dot syntax</a>.  It provides access to a small
    number of primitive representation types and operations defined over them
    that map directly to LLVM IR.</p>
  
  <p>The existance of and details of this module are a private implementation
     detail used by our implementation of the standard library.  Swift code
     outside the standard library should not be aware of this library, and an
     independent implementation of the swift standard library should be
     allowed to be implemented without the builtin library if it desires.</p>
  
  <p>For reference below, the description of the standard library uses the
     "Builtin." namespace to refer to this module, but independent
     implementations could use another implementation if they so desire.</p>
