# How to Set Up an Edit-Build-Test-Debug Loop

This document describes how to set up a development loop for people interested
in contributing to Swift.

If you are only interested in building the
toolchain as a one-off, there are a couple of differences:
1. You can ignore the parts related to Sccache.
2. You can stop reading after
   [Building the project for the first time](#building-the-project-for-the-first-time).

## System Requirements

1. Operating system:
   The supported operating systems for developing the Swift toolchain are:
   macOS, Ubuntu Linux LTS, and the latest Ubuntu Linux release.
   At the moment, Windows is not supported as a host development operating
   system. Experimental instructions for Windows are available under
   [Windows.md](/docs/Windows.md).
2. Python 3: Several utility scripts are written in Python.
3. Disk space:
   Make sure that you have enough available disk space before starting.
   The source code, including full git history, requires about 3.5 GB.
   Build artifacts take anywhere between 5 GB to 70 GB, depending on the
   build settings.
4. Time:
   Depending on your machine and build settings,
   a from-scratch build can take a few minutes to several hours,
   so you might want to grab a beverage while you follow the instructions.
   Incremental builds are much faster.

## Cloning the project

1. Create a directory for the whole project:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p swift-project/swift
   cd swift-project/swift
   ```
2. Clone the sources:
   - Via SSH (recommended):
     If you plan on contributing regularly, cloning over SSH provides a better
     experience. After you've [uploaded your SSH keys to GitHub][]:
     ```sh
     git clone git@github.com:apple/swift.git .
     utils/update-checkout --clone-with-ssh
     ```
   - Via HTTPS:
     If you want to check out the sources as read-only,
     or are not familiar with setting up SSH,
     you can use HTTPS instead:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/apple/swift.git .
     utils/update-checkout --clone
     ```
   **Note:** If you've already forked the project on GitHub at this stage,
   **do not clone your fork** to start off. We describe
   [how to setup your fork](#setting-up-your-fork) in a subsection below.
   <!-- Recommending against cloning the fork due to SR-13476 and SR-13505. -->
3. Double-check that `swift`'s sibling directories are present.
   ```sh
   ls ..
   ```
   This should list directories like `llvm-project`, `swiftpm` and so on.
4. Checkout the right branch/tag:
   If you are building the toolchain for local development, you can skip this
   step, as Step 2 will checkout `swift`'s `master` branch and matching
   branches for other projects. <!-- [TODO: master-to-main-rename] -->
   If you are building the toolchain as a one-off, it is more likely that you
   want a specific branch or a tag, often corresponding to a specific release
   or a specific snapshot. You can update the branch/tag for all repositories
   as follows:
   ```sh
   utils/update-checkout --branch mybranchname
   # OR
   utils/update-checkout --tag mytagname
   ```
   Detailed branching information, including names for release branches, can
   be found in [Branches.md](/docs/Branches.md).

**Note:**
The commands used in the rest of this guide assumes that the absolute path
to your working directory is something like `/path/to/swift-project/swift`.
Double-check that running `pwd` prints a path ending with `swift`.

[uploaded your SSH keys to GitHub]: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/

### Troubleshooting cloning issues

- If `update-checkout` failed, double-check that the absolute path to your
  working directory does not have non-ASCII characters.
- If `update-checkout` failed and the absolute path to your working directory
  had spaces in it, please [file a bug report][Swift JIRA] and change the path
  to work around it.
- Before running `update-checkout`, double-check that `swift` is the only
  repository inside the `swift-project` directory. Otherwise,
  `update-checkout` may not clone the necessary dependencies.

## Installing dependencies

### macOS

1. Install [Xcode 12 beta 3][Xcode] or newer:
   The required version of Xcode changes frequently and is often a beta release.
   Check this document or the host information on <https://ci.swift.org> for the
   current required version.
2. Install [CMake][], [Ninja][] and [Sccache][]:
   - Via [Homebrew][] (recommended):
     ```sh
     brew install cmake ninja sccache
     ```
   - Via [Homebrew Bundle][]:
     ```sh
     brew bundle
     ```

[Xcode]: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/
[CMake]: https://cmake.org
[Ninja]: https://ninja-build.org
[Sccache]: https://github.com/mozilla/sccache
[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh/
[Homebrew Bundle]: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle

### Ubuntu Linux

1. For Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and 18.04 LTS, run the following:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install    \
     clang                 \
     cmake                 \
     git                   \
     icu-devtools          \
     libcurl4-openssl-dev  \
     libedit-dev           \
     libicu-dev            \
     libncurses5-dev       \
     libpython3-dev        \
     libsqlite3-dev        \
     libxml2-dev           \
     ninja-build           \
     pkg-config            \
     python                \
     python-six            \
     rsync                 \
     swig                  \
     systemtap-sdt-dev     \
     tzdata                \
     uuid-dev
   sudo snap install sccache --candidate --classic
   ```

   **Note:** LLDB currently requires at least `swig-1.3.40` but will
   successfully build with version 2 shipped with Ubuntu.

## Building the project for the first time

### Spot check dependencies

* Run `cmake --version`: This should be 3.18.1 or higher for macOS.
* Run `python3 --version`: Check that this succeeds.
* Run `ninja --version`: Check that this succeeds.
* Run `sccache --version`: Check that this succeeds.

### The roles of different tools

At this point, it is worthwhile to pause for a moment
to understand what the different tools do:

1. On macOS and Windows, IDEs (Xcode and Visual Studio resp.) serve as an
   easy way to install development dependencies such as a C++ compiler,
   a linker, header files, etc. The IDE's build system need not be used to
   build Swift. On Linux, these dependencies are installed by the
   distribution's package manager.
2. CMake is a cross-platform build system for C and C++.
   It forms the core infrastructure used to _configure_ builds of
   Swift and its companion projects.
3. Ninja is a low-level build system that can be used to _build_ the project,
   as an alternative to Xcode's build system. Ninja is somewhat faster,
   especially for incremental builds, and supports more build environments.
4. Sccache is a caching tool:
   If you ever delete your build directory and rebuild from scratch
   (i.e. do a "clean build"), Sccache can accelerate the new build
   significantly. There are few things more satisfying than seeing Sccache
   cut through build times.
5. `utils/update-checkout` is a script to help you work with all the individual
   git repositories together, instead of manually cloning/updating each one.
6. `utils/build-script` (we will introduce this shortly)
   is a high-level automation script that handles configuration (via CMake),
   building (via Ninja or Xcode), caching (via Sccache), running tests and more.

> **Pro Tip**: Most tools support `--help` flags describing the options they
> support. Additionally, both Clang and the Swift compiler have hidden flags
> (`clang --help-hidden`/`swiftc --help-hidden`) and frontend flags
> (`clang -cc1 --help`/`swiftc -frontend --help`) and the Swift compiler
> even has hidden frontend flags (`swiftc -frontend --help-hidden`). Sneaky!

Phew, that's a lot to digest! Now let's proceed to the actual build itself!

### The actual build

1. Make sure you have Sccache running.
   ```sh
   sccache --start-server
   ```
   (Optional) Sccache defaults to a cache size of 10GB, which is relatively
   small compared to build artifacts. You can bump it up, say by setting
   `export SCCACHE_CACHE_SIZE="50G"` in your dotfile(s). For more details,
   see the [Sccache README][Sccache].
2. Decide if you would like to build the toolchain using Ninja or using Xcode.
   - If you use an editor other than Xcode and/or you want somewhat faster builds,
     go with Ninja.
   - If you are comfortable with using Xcode and would prefer to use it,
     go with Xcode.
   There is also a third option, which is somewhat more involved:
   [using both Ninja and Xcode](#using-both-ninja-and-xcode).
3. Build the toolchain with optimizations, debuginfo, and assertions and run
   the tests.
   - Via Ninja:
     ```sh
     utils/build-script --skip-build-benchmarks \
       --skip-ios --skip-watchos --skip-tvos --swift-darwin-supported-archs "x86_64" \
       --cmake-c-launcher="$(which sccache)" --cmake-cxx-launcher="$(which sccache)" \
       --release-debuginfo --test
     ```
   - Via Xcode:
     ```sh
     utils/build-script --skip-build-benchmarks \
       --skip-ios --skip-watchos --skip-tvos --swift-darwin-supported-archs "x86_64" \
       --cmake-c-launcher="$(which sccache)" --cmake-cxx-launcher="$(which sccache)" \
       --release-debuginfo --test \
       --xcode
     ```
   This will create a directory
   `swift-project/build/Ninja-RelWithDebInfoAssert`
   (with `Xcode` instead of `Ninja` if you used `--xcode`)
   containing the build artifacts.
   - If the build succeeds: Once the build is complete, the tests will run.
     - If the tests are passing: Great! We can go to the next step.
     - If some tests are failing:
       - Consider [filing a bug report](https://swift.org/contributing/#reporting-bugs).
       - Note down which tests are failing as a baseline. This baseline will be
         handy later when you run the tests after making a change.
   - If the build fails:
     See [Troubleshooting build issues](#troubleshooting-build-issues).

In the following sections, for simplicity, we will assume that you are using a
`Ninja-RelWithDebInfoAssert` build on macOS running on an Intel-based Mac,
unless explicitly mentioned otherwise. You will need to slightly tweak the paths
for other build configurations.

#### Using both Ninja and Xcode

Some contributors find it more convenient to use both Ninja and Xcode.
Typically this configuration consists of:

1. A Ninja build created with `--release-debuginfo`.
2. An Xcode build created with `--release-debuginfo --debug-swift`.

The Ninja build can be used for fast incremental compilation and running tests
quickly. The Xcode build can be used for debugging with high fidelity.

The additional flexibility comes with two issues: (1) consuming much more disk
space and (2) you need to maintain the two builds in sync, which needs extra
care when moving across branches.

### Troubleshooting build issues

- Double-check that all projects are checked out at the right branches.
  A common failure mode is using `git checkout` to change the branch only
  for `swift` (often to a release branch), leading to an unsupported
  configuration. See Step 4 of [Cloning the Project](#cloning-the-project)
  on how to fix this.
- Double-check that all your dependencies
  [meet the minimum required versions](#spot-check-dependencies).
- Check if there are spaces in the paths being used by `build-script` in
  the log. While `build-script` should work with paths containing spaces,
  sometimes bugs do slip through, such as
  [SR-13441](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13441).
  If this is the case, please [file a bug report][Swift JIRA] and change the path
  to work around it.
- Check that your `build-script` invocation doesn't have typos. You can compare
  the flags you passed against the supported flags listed by
  `utils/build-script --help`.
- Check the error logs and see if there is something you can fix.
  In many situations, there are several errors, so scrolling further back
  and looking at the first error may be more helpful than simply looking
  at the last error.
- Check if others have encountered the same issue on the Swift forums or on
  [Swift JIRA][].
- Create a new Swift forums thread in the Development category. Include
  information about your configuration and the errors you are seeing.
  - You can [create a gist](https://gist.github.com) with the entire build
    output and link it, while highlighting the most important part of the
    build log in the post.
  - Include the output of `utils/update-checkout --dump-hashes`.

## Editing code

### Setting up your fork

If you are building the toolchain for development and submitting patches,
you will need to setup a GitHub fork.

First fork the `apple/swift` [repository](https://github.com/apple/swift.git),
using the "Fork" button in the web UI, near the top-right. This will create a
repository `username/swift` for your GitHub username. Next, add it as a remote:
```sh
# Using 'my-remote' as a placeholder name.

# If you set up SSH in step 2
git remote add my-remote git@github.com:username/swift.git

# If you used HTTPS in step 2
git remote add my-remote https://github.com/username/swift.git
```
Finally, create a new branch.
```sh
# Using 'my-branch' as a placeholder name
git checkout my-branch
git push --set-upstream my-remote my-branch
```

### First time Xcode setup

If you used `--xcode` earlier, you will see an Xcode project generated under
`../build/Xcode-RelWithDebInfoAssert/swift-macosx-x86_64`. When you open the
project, Xcode might helpfully suggest "Automatically Create Schemes". Most of
those schemes are not required in day-to-day work, so you can instead manually
select the following schemes:
- `swift-frontend`: If you will be working on the compiler.
- `check-swift-all`: This can be used to run the tests. The test runner does
  not integrate with Xcode though, so it may be easier to run tests directly
  on the commandline for more fine-grained control over which exact tests are
  run.
<!-- TODO: Insert SourceKit/stdlib specific instructions? -->

### Editing

Make changes to the code as appropriate. Implement a shiny new feature!
Or fix a nasty bug! Update the documentation as you go! <!-- please 🙏 -->
The codebase is your oyster!

:construction::construction_worker::building_construction:

Now that you have made some changes, you will need to rebuild...

### Incremental builds with Ninja

To rebuild the compiler:
```sh
ninja -C ../build/Ninja-RelWithDebInfoAssert/swift-macosx-x86_64 swift-frontend
```

To rebuild everything, including the standard library:
```sh
ninja -C ../build/Ninja-RelWithDebInfoAssert/swift-macosx-x86_64
```

### Incremental builds with Xcode

Rebuilding works the same way as with any other Xcode project; you can use
<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> or Product → Build.

### Spot checking an incremental build

As a quick test, go to `lib/Basic/Version.cpp` and tweak the version
printing code slightly. Next, do an incremental build as above. This incremental
build should be much faster than the from-scratch build at the beginning.
Now check if the version string has been updated:

```sh
../build/Ninja-RelWithDebInfoAssert/swift-macosx-x86_64/bin/swift-frontend --version
```

This should print your updated version string.

## Reproducing an issue

Starter bugs typically have small code examples that fit within a single file.
You can reproduce such an issue in various ways, such as compiling it from the
commandline using `/path/to/swiftc MyFile.swift`, pasting the code into
[Compiler Explorer][] (aka godbolt) or using an Xcode Playground.

[Compiler Explorer]: https://godbolt.org

For files using frameworks from an SDK bundled with Xcode, you need the pass
the SDK explicitly. Here are a couple of examples:
```sh
# Compile a file to an executable for your local machine.
xcrun -sdk macosx /path/to/swiftc MyFile.swift

# Say you are trying to compile a file importing an iOS-only framework.
xcrun -sdk iphoneos /path/to/swiftc -target arm64-apple-ios13.0 MyFile.swift
```
You can see the full list of `-sdk` options using `xcodebuild -showsdks`,
and check some potential `-target` options for different operating systems by
skimming the compiler's test suite under `test/`.

Sometimes bug reports come with SwiftPM packages or Xcode projects as minimal
reproducers. While we do not add packages or projects to the compiler's test
suite, it is generally helpful to first reproduce the issue in context before
trying to create a minimal self-contained test case. If that's the case with
the bug you're working on, check out our
[instructions on building packages and Xcode projects with a locally built compiler](/docs/HowToGuides/FAQ.md#how-do-i-use-a-locally-built-compiler-to-build-x).

## Running tests

There are two main ways to run tests:

1. `utils/run-test`: By default, `run-test` builds the tests' dependencies
   before running them.
   ```sh
   # Rebuild all test dependencies and run all tests under test/.
   utils/run-test --lit ../llvm-project/llvm/utils/lit/lit.py \
     ../build/Ninja-RelWithDebInfoAssert/swift-macosx-x86_64/test-macosx-x86_64

   # Rebuild all test dependencies and run tests containing "MyTest".
   utils/run-test --lit ../llvm-project/llvm/utils/lit/lit.py \
     ../build/Ninja-RelWithDebInfoAssert/swift-macosx-x86_64/test-macosx-x86_64 \
     --filter="MyTest"
   ```
2. `lit.py`: lit doesn't know anything about dependencies. It just runs tests.
   ```sh
   # Run all tests under test/.
   ../llvm-project/llvm/utils/lit/lit.py -s -vv \
     ../build/Ninja-RelWithDebInfoAssert/swift-macosx-x86_64/test-macosx-x86_64

   # Run tests containing "MyTest"
   ../llvm-project/llvm/utils/lit/lit.py -s -vv \
     ../build/Ninja-RelWithDebInfoAssert/swift-macosx-x86_64/test-macosx-x86_64 \
     --filter="MyTest"
   ```
   The `-s` and `-vv` flags print a progress bar and the executed commands
   respectively.

If you making small changes to the compiler or some other component, you'll
likely want to [incrementally rebuild](#editing-code) only the relevant
Ninja/Xcode target and use `lit.py` with `--filter`. One potential failure
mode with this approach is accidental use of stale binaries. For example, say
that you want to rerun a SourceKit test but you only incrementally rebuilt the
compiler. Then your changes will not be reflected when the test runs because the
`sourcekitd` binary was not rebuilt. Using `run-test` instead is the safer
option, but it will lead to a longer feedback loop due to more things getting
rebuilt.

If you want to rerun all the tests, you can either rebuild the whole project
and use `lit.py` without `--filter` or use `run-test` to handle both aspects.

Recall the baseline failures mentioned in
[the build section](#the-actual-build). If your baseline had failing tests, make
sure you compare the failures seen after your changes to the baseline. If some
test failures look totally unrelated to your changes, there is a good chance
that they were already failing as part of the baseline.

For more details on running tests and understanding the various Swift-specific
lit customizations, see [Testing.md](/docs/Testing.md). Also check out the
[lit documentation](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lit.html) to understand
how the different lit commands work.

## Debugging issues

In this section, we briefly describe two common ways of debugging: print
debugging and using LLDB.

Depending on the code you're interested in, LLDB may be significantly more
effective when using a debug build. Depending on what components you are
working on, you could turn off optimizations for only a few things.
Here are some example invocations:

```sh
# optimized Stdlib + debug Swiftc + optimized Clang/LLVM
utils/build-script --release-debuginfo --debug-swift # other flags...

# debug Stdlib + optimized Swiftc + optimized Clang/LLVM
utils/build-script --release-debuginfo --debug-swift-stdlib # other flags...

# optimized Stdlib + debug Swiftc (except typechecker) + optimized Clang/LLVM
utils/build-script --release-debuginfo --debug-swift --force-optimized-typechecker

# Last resort option, it is highly unlikely that you will need this
# debug Stdlib + debug Swiftc + debug Clang/LLVM
utils/build-script --debug # other flags...
```

Debug builds have two major drawbacks:
- A debug compiler is much slower, leading to longer feedback loops in case you
  need to repeatedly compile the Swift standard library and/or run a large
  number of tests.
- The build artifacts consume a lot more disk space.

[DebuggingTheCompiler.md](/docs/DebuggingTheCompiler.md) goes into a LOT
more detail on how you can level up your debugging skills! Make sure you check
it out in case you're trying to debug a tricky issue and aren't sure how to
go about it.

### Print debugging

A large number of types have `dump(..)`/`print(..)` methods which can be used
along with `llvm::errs()` or other LLVM streams. For example, if you have a
variable `std::vector<CanType> canTypes` that you want to print, you could do:
```cpp
auto &e = llvm::errs();
e << "canTypes = [";
llvm::interleaveComma(canTypes, e, [&](auto ty) { ty.dump(e); });
e << "]\n";
```
You can also crash the compiler using `assert`/`llvm_unreachable`/
`llvm::report_fatal_error`, after accumulating the result in a stream:
```cpp
std::string msg; llvm::raw_string_ostream os(msg);
os << "unexpected canTypes = [";
llvm::interleaveComma(canTypes, os, [&](auto ty) { ty.dump(os); });
os << "] !!!\n";
llvm::report_fatal_error(os.str());
```

### Debugging using LLDB

When the compiler crashes, the commandline arguments passed to it will be
printed to stderr. It will likely look something like:

```
/path/to/swift-frontend <args>
```

- Using LLDB on the commandline: Copy the entire invocation and pass it to LLDB.
  ```sh
  lldb -- /path/to/swift-frontend <args>
  ```
  Now you can use the usual LLDB commands like `run`, `breakpoint set` and so
  on. If you are new to LLDB, check out the [official LLDB documentation][] and
  [nesono's LLDB cheat sheet][].
- Using LLDB within Xcode:
  Select the current scheme 'swift-frontend' → Edit Scheme → Run phase →
  Arguments tab. Under "Arguments Passed on Launch", copy-paste the `<args>`
  and make sure that "Expand Variables Based On" is set to swift-frontend.
  Close the scheme editor. If you now run the compiler
  (<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> or Product → Run), you will be able to use the
  Xcode debugger.

  Xcode also has the ability to attach to and debug Swift processes launched
  elsewhere. Under Debug → Attach to Process by PID or name..., you can enter
  a compiler process's PID or name (`swift-frontend`) to debug a compiler
  instance invoked elsewhere. This can be helpful if you have a single compiler
  process being invoked by another tool, such as SwiftPM or another open Xcode
  project.
