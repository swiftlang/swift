\chapter[]{Concrete Conformances}\label{concrete conformances}

\ifWIP
TODO:
\begin{itemize}
\item Concrete conformance rule, property-like
\item Virtual rule that introduces it
\item Idea: it should eliminate the conformance rule but not the concrete type rule
\item Doesn't actually appear in signature so should not impact minimization
\item Conditional requirement inference, only in generic signatures and not protocols, because we can't merge connected components during completion. for a generic signature this actually has to import new components in the general case
\end{itemize}

\section[]{Type Witnesses}\label{rqm type witnesses}

\IndexTwoFlag{debug-requirement-machine}{concretize-nested-types}

\ifWIP
TODO:
\begin{itemize}
\item Concrete type witness
\item Abstract type witness
\item Virtual rules
\item Algorithm for building a ``relative'' concrete type symbol from substituting another symbol's pattern type
\end{itemize}

\section[]{Recursive Conformances}

\ifWIP
TODO:
\begin{itemize}
\item Free conformances
\item Can a protocol have a free conformance
\item Can a conformance be made free by changing the protocol
\item Conformance evaluation graph
\item Heuristic to find same-type requirements from a conformance; just the parent type thing
\item The problem with opaque archetypes
\item Open question: can we encode a conformance more directly without evaluating it; \verb|G<G<G<T>>>| example
\end{itemize}

\IndexDefinition{concrete contraction}

\ifWIP
TODO:
\begin{itemize}
\item Doesn't actually appear in signature so should not impact minimization
\item The problem: it might give you a smaller anchor
\item Invariant violation without concrete contraction
\item Concrete contraction substitutes superclass and concrete types
\item Also GSB compatibility: T.A, T == C, C.A is a concrete typealias that's not an associated type. this doesn't add a rule
\item Open question: can we do this in a more principled way
\end{itemize}
