% KOMA-Script 'scrbook' document class
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% From left to right, each option does the following:
% - A4 page size. Do not change!
% - Draw line under chapter/section heading at top of page
% - Next three options force use of serif fonts for part, chapter and section headings
% - Put Bibliography in Table of Contents
% - Use 'flat' ToC style because it looks better with double-digit chapter numbers
% - Use 'fleqn' to left-align display math to make it consistent with the 'quote' environment which I use for tables and diagrams and stuff
%
% - Changing `twoside=semi' to `twoside' is safe. The default mode is meant for reading on-screen. If you make this change, even pages have a wider left margin, and odd pages have a wider right margin, which looks silly when scrolling vertically, but makes sense if you actually print and bind the book.

%
% The above example would be generated by: \index{foo}\index{foo!z@\igobble|seealso{bar}}
