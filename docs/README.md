# Documentation Index

This page describes the overall organization of documentation for the Swift toolchain.
It is divided into the following sections:

- [Tutorials](#tutorials)
  gently guide you towards achieving introductory tasks,
  while assuming minimal background knowledge.
- [How-To Guides](#how-to-guides)
  help you complete specific tasks in a step-by-step fashion.
- [Explanations](#explanations)
  discuss key subsystems and concepts, at a high level.
  They also provide background information and talk about design tradeoffs.
- [Reference Guides](#reference-guides)
  contain a thorough technical reference for complex topics.
  They assume some overall understanding of surrounding subsystems.
- [Recommended Practices](#recommended-practices)
  suggests guidelines for writing code and diagnostics.
- [Project Information](#project-information)
  tracks continuous integration (CI), branching and release history.
- [Evolution Documents](#evolution-documents)
  includes proposals and manifestos for changes to Swift.
- The [External Resources](#external-resources) section provides links to
  valuable discussions about Swift development, in the form of talks
  and blog posts.
- The [Uncategorized](#uncategorized) section is for documentation which does
  not fit neatly into any of the above categories. We would like to minimize
  items in this section; avoid adding new documentation here.

Sometimes documentation is not enough.
Especially if you are a new contributor, you might run into roadblocks
which are not addressed by the existing documentation.
Or they are addressed somewhere but you cannot find the relevant bits.
If you are stuck, please use the [development category][] on the Swift forums
to ask for help!

Lastly, note that we are slowly moving towards a more structured form of
documentation, inspired by the Django project [[1][Django-docs-1]]
[[2][Django-docs-2]]. Hence parts of this page are aspirational
and do not reflect how much of the existing documentation is written.
Pull requests to clean up the [Uncategorized](#uncategorized) section,
or generally fill gaps in the documentation are very welcome.
If you would like to make major changes, such as adding entire new pieces of
documentation, please create a thread on the Swift forums under the
[development category][] to discuss your proposed changes.

### Needs refactoring

The documents in this section might be worth breaking up into several documents,
and linking one document from the other. Breaking up into components will
provide greater clarity to contributors wanting to add new documentation.

- [ARCOptimization.md](/docs/SIL/ARCOptimization.md):
  Covers how ARC optimization works, with several examples.
  TODO: Not clear if this is intended to be an explanation or a reference guide.
- [CompilerPerformance.md](/docs/CompilerPerformance.md):
  Thoroughly discusses different ways of measuring compiler performance
  and common pitfalls.
  TODO: Consider breaking up into one high-level explanation explaining key
  concepts and individual how-to guides that can be expanded independently.
  Also, it's not the right place to explain details of different compiler modes.
- [DevelopmentTips.md](/docs/DevelopmentTips.md):
  Contains an assortment of tips for better productivity when working on the
  compiler.
  TODO: Might be worthwhile to make a dedicated how-to guide or explanation.
  It might also be valuable to introduce the tips in context, and have the
  explanation link to all the different tips.
- [Diagnostics.md](/docs/Diagnostics.md):
  Describes how to write diagnostic messages and associated documentation.
  TODO: Consider splitting into how-tos and recommended practices.
  For example, we could have a how-to guide on adding a new diagnostic,
  and have a recommended practices page which explains the writing style
  for diagnostics and diagnostic groups.
- [HowSwiftImportsCAPIs.md](/docs/HowSwiftImportsCAPIs.md):
  Contains a thorough description of the mapping between C/ObjC entities and
  Swift entities.
  TODO: Not clear if this is intended to be language documentation
  (for Swift developers), an explanation or a reference guide.
- [Modules.md](/docs/Modules.md): was written for Swift pre-1.0, but is still
  relevant and covers behavior that's underspecified in either TSPL or the
  language reference.
- [OptimizerCountersAnalysis.md](/docs/OptimizerCountersAnalysis.md):
  TODO: Consider breaking up into a how-to guide
  on dumping and analyzing the counters
  and an explanation for the counter collection system.
- [Testing.md](/docs/Testing.md):
  TODO: Consider splitting into a how-to guide on writing a new test case
  and an explanation for how the compiler is tested.
- [Random.md](/docs/Random.md): Stub.

### Archive

- [FailableInitializers.md](/docs/FailableInitializers.md):
  Superseded by documentation in [The Swift Programming Language][].
- [InitializerProblems.rst](/docs/InitializerProblems.rst):
  Describes some complexities around initialization in Swift.
  TODO: It would be great to have an explanation, say `InitializationModel.md`,
  that covers the initialization model and new attributes like
  `@_hasMissingDesignatedInitializers`. Some of this is covered in
  [TSPL's initialization section][] but that doesn't include newly added
  attributes.
- [Swift3Compatibility.md](/docs/Swift3Compatibility.md):
  Discusses the Swift 3 -> Swift 4 migration.
- [StoredAndComputedVariables.rst](/docs/StoredAndComputedVariables.rst): for Swift pre-1.0.
