# Underscored Attributes Reference

**WARNING:** This information is provided primarily for compiler and standard
library developers. Usage of these attributes outside of the Swift monorepo
is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.

The Swift reference has a chapter discussing [stable attributes][Attributes].
This document is intended to serve as a counterpart describing underscored
attributes, whose semantics are subject to change and most likely need to
go through the Swift evolution process before being stabilized.

[Attributes]: https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Attributes.html

The attributes are organized in alphabetical order.

## `@_alignment(numericValue)`

Allows controlling the alignment of a type.

The alignment value specified must be a power of two, and cannot be less
than the "natural" alignment of the type that would otherwise be used by
the Swift ABI. This attribute is intended for the SIMD types in the standard
library which use it to increase the alignment of their internal storage to at
least 16 bytes.

## `@_alwaysEmitConformanceMetadata`

Forces conformances of the attributed protocol to always have their Type Metadata get emitted into the binary and prevents it from being optimized away or stripped by the linker.

## `@_alwaysEmitIntoClient`

Forces the body of a function to be emitted into client code.

Note that this is distinct from `@inline(__always)`; it doesn't force inlining
at call-sites, it only means that the implementation is compiled into the
module which uses the code.

This means that `@_alwaysEmitIntoClient` definitions are _not_ part of the
defining module's ABI, so changing the implementation at a later stage
does not break ABI.

Most notably, default argument expressions are implicitly
`@_alwaysEmitIntoClient`, which means that adding a default argument to a
function which did not have one previously does not break ABI.

## `@_assemblyVision`

Forces emission of assembly vision remarks for a function or method, showing
where various runtime calls and performance impacting hazards are in the code
at source level after optimization.

Adding this attribute to a type leads to remarks being emitted for all methods.

## `@_backDeploy(before: ...)`

The spelling of `@backDeployed(before:)` prior to the acceptance of [SE-0376](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0376-function-back-deployment.md).

## `@_borrowed`

Indicates that the [conservative access pattern](/docs/Lexicon.md#access-pattern)
for some storage (a subscript or a property) should use the `_read` accessor
instead of `get`.

For more details, see the forum post on
[Value ownership when reading from a storage declaration](https://forums.swift.org/t/value-ownership-when-reading-from-a-storage-declaration/15076).

## `@_cdecl("cName")`

Similar to `@_silgen_name` but uses the C calling convention.

This attribute doesn't have very well-defined semantics. Type bridging is not
done, so the parameter and return types should correspond directly to types
accessible in C. In most cases, it is preferable to define a static method
on an `@objc` class instead of using `@_cdecl`.

For potential ideas on stabilization, see
[Formalizing `@cdecl`](https://forums.swift.org/t/formalizing-cdecl/40677).

## `@_disfavoredOverload`

Marks an overload that the type checker should try to avoid using. When the
expression type checker is considering overloads, it will prefer a solution
with fewer `@_disfavoredOverload` declarations over one with more of them.

Use `@_disfavoredOverload` to work around known bugs in the overload
resolution rules that cannot be immediately fixed without a source break.
Don't use it to adjust overload resolution rules that are otherwise sensible
but happen to produce undesirable results for your particular API; it will
likely be removed or made into a no-op eventually, and then you will be
stuck with an overload set that cannot be made to function in the way
you intend.

`@_disfavoredOverload` was first introduced to work around a bug in overload
resolution with `ExpressibleByXYZLiteral` types. The type checker strongly
prefers to give literals their default type (e.g. `Int` for
`ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral`, `String` for `ExpressibleByStringLiteral`,
etc.). If an API should prefer some other type, but accept the default too,
 marking the declaration taking the default type with `@_disfavoredOverload`
 gives the desired behavior:

```swift
extension LocalizedStringKey: ExpressibleByStringLiteral { ... }

extension Text {
  // We want `Text("foo")` to use this initializer:
  init(_ key: LocalizedStringKey) { ... }

  // But without @_disfavoredOverload, it would use this one instead,
  // because that lets it give the literal its default type:
  @_disfavoredOverload init<S: StringProtocol>(_ str: S) { ... }
}
```

## `@_documentation(metadata: ...)`

Adds "documentation metadata" to the symbol. The identifier in the attribute is
added to the symbol graph in the `"metadata"` field of the symbol. This can be
used to add an arbitrary grouping or other indicator to symbols for use in
documentation.

## `@_documentation(visibility: ...)`

Forces the symbol to be treated as the given access level when checking
visibility. This can be used to, for example, force a symbol with an underscored
name to appear in `public` symbol graphs, or treat an otherwise-`public` symbol
as being `internal` or `private` for the purposes of documentation, to hide it
from `public` docs.

This can also be applied to `@_exported import` statements to only include the
imported symbols in symbol graphs with the given minimum access level. For
example, applying `@_documentation(visibility: internal)` to an `@_exported
import` statement will hide the imported symbols from `public` symbol graphs and
documentation, but show them on `internal` symbol graphs and documentation.

## `@_dynamicReplacement(for: targetFunc(label:))`

Marks a function as the dynamic replacement for another `dynamic` function.
This is similar to method swizzling in other languages such as Objective-C,
except that the replacement happens at program start (or loading a shared
library), instead of at an arbitrary point in time.

For more details, see the forum post on
[dynamic method replacement](https://forums.swift.org/t/dynamic-method-replacement/16619).

## `@_eagerMove`

When applied to a value, indicates that the value's lifetime is _not_ lexical,
that releases of the value may be hoisted without respect to deinit barriers.

When applied to a type, indicates that all values which are _statically_
instances of that type are themselves `@_eagerMove` as above, unless overridden
with `@_noEagerMove`.

Aggregates all of whose fields are `@_eagerMove` or trivial are inferred to be
`@_eagerMove`.

Note that a value of an `@_eagerMove` type that is passed to a generic API (to a
parameter not annotated `@_eagerMove` will, in that generic function's context,
not be statically an instance of the `@_eagerMove` type.  As a result it will
have a lexical lifetime in that function.

## `@_effects(effectname)`

Tells the compiler that the implementation of the defined function is limited
to certain side effects. The attribute argument specifies the kind of side
effect limitations that apply to the function including any other functions
it calls. This is used to provide information to the optimizer that it can't
already infer from static analysis.

Changing the implementation in a way that violates the optimizer's assumptions
about the effects results in undefined behavior.

### `@_effects(readnone)`

Defines that the function does not have any observable memory reads or writes
or any other observable side effects.

This does not mean that the function cannot read or write memory at all.
For example, it’s allowed to allocate and write to local objects inside the
function. For example, the following `readnone` function allocates an array and
writes to the array buffer

```swift
@_effects(readnone)
func lookup(_ i: Int) -> Int {
  let a = [7, 3 ,6, 9]
  return a[i]
}
```

A function can be marked as readnone if two calls of the same function with the
same parameters can be simplified to one call (e.g. by the CSE optimization)
without changing the semantics of the program.
For example,

```swift
  let a = lookup(i)
  // some other code, including memory writes
  let b = lookup(i)
```
is equivalent to

```swift
  let a = lookup(i)
  // some other code, including memory writes
  let b = a
```

Some conclusions:

* A `readnone` function must not return a newly allocated class instance.

* A `readnone` function can return a newly allocated copy-on-write object, like
  an Array, because COW data types conceptually behave like value types.

* A `readnone` function must not release any parameter or any object indirectly
  referenced from a parameter.

* Any kind of observable side-effects are not allowed, like `print`, file IO, etc.

The `readnone` attribute cannot be used on functions that take
nontrivial owned arguments for the reasons explained in the next
section on `@_effects(readonly)`.

### `@_effects(readonly)`

Defines that the function does not have any observable memory writes or any
other observable side effects, beside reading of memory.

Similar to `readnone`, a `readonly` function is allowed to write to local objects.

A function can be marked as `readonly` if it’s safe to eliminate a call to such
a function in case its return value is not used.
Example:

```swift
@_effects(readonly)
func lookup2(_ instance: SomeClass) -> Int {
  let a = [7, 3 ,6, 9]
  return a[instance.i]
}
```

It is legal to eliminate an unused call to this function:

```
_ = lookup2(i)  // can be completely eliminated
```

Note that it would not be legal to CSE two calls to this function, because
between those calls the member `i` of the class instance could be modified:

```swift
  let a = lookup2(instance)
  instance.i += 1
  let b = lookup2(instance)   // cannot be CSE'd with the first call
```

The same conclusions as for `readnone` also apply to `readonly`.

The `readonly` and `readnone` effects are sensitive to the ARC calling
convention, which normally has no effect on language semantics. These
effects attributes can only be used correctly by knowing whether the
compiler will pass any nontrivial arguments as guaranteed or owned. If
the function takes an owned argument, as is the case for initializers
and setters, then `readonly` is likely invalid because removing the call
would fail to release the argument. Additionally, the release itself
may run a tree of deinitializers with potentially arbitrary side
effects.

In special situations, the library author may still want to use
`readonly` for functions with owned arguments. They must be able to
guarantee that the owned arguments are not effectively released from
the caller's perspective. This could be because all paths through the
function have an equivalent retain, or they may know that the argument
is a tagged object for which a release has no effect. To make sure
this is intentional, the library author must also explicitly specify
`_effects(releasenone)` even though that is normally already implied
by `readonly`.

For example, it is valid to give the following trivial initializer
`readonly` and `releasenone` attributes:

    @_effects(readonly) @_effects(releasenone)
    init(_ c: C) { self.c = c }

If `C` is a class, then the value returned by the initializer must
have at least one use in the form of a release. The optimizer,
therefore, may not remove the call to the initializer without
deliberately compensating for ownership.

For the same reason that developers must take care regarding argument
ownership, the compiler must always check for `readonly` and
`readnone` effects attributes before transforming a function
signature. Normally, this optimization can be done independent of
language semantics, but such optimizations should be avoided for
functions with these effects attributes.

### `@_effects(releasenone)`

Defines that the function does not release any class instance.

This effect must be used with care.
There are several code patterns which release objects in a non-obvious way.
For example:

* A parameter which is passed to an “owned” argument (and not stored), like
  initializer arguments.

* Assignments, because they release the old value

* COW data types, e.g. Strings. Conceptually they are value types, but
  internally the keep a reference counted buffer.

* Class references deep inside a hierarchy of value types.

### `@_effects(readwrite)`

This effect is not used by the compiler.

### `@_effects(notEscaping <selection>)`

Tells the compiler that a function argument does not escape.
The _selection_ specifies which argument or which "projection" of an argument
does not escape. The _selection_ consists of the argument name or `self` and
an optional projection path.

The projection path consists of field names or one of the following wildcards:

* `class*`: selects any class field, including tail allocated elements
* `value**`: selects any number and any kind of struct, tuple or enum
             fields/payload-cases.
* `**`: selects any number of any fields

For example:

```swift
struct Inner {
  let i: Class
}
struct Str {
	let a: Inner
	let b: Class
}

@_effects(notEscaping s.b)    // s.b does not escape, but s.a.i can escape
func foo1(_ s: Str) { ... }

@_effects(notEscaping s.v**)  // s.b and s.a.i do not escape
func foo2(_ s: Str) { ... }

@_effects(notEscaping s.**)   // s.b, s.a.i and all transitively reachable
                              // references from there do not escape
func foo3(_ s: Str) { ... }
```

### `@_effects(escaping <from-selection> => <to-selection>)`

Defines that an argument escapes to another argument or to the return value,
but not otherwise.
The _to-selection_ can also refer to `return`.

For example:

```swift
@_effects(escapes s.b => return)
func foo1(_ s: Str) -> Class {
  return s.b
}

@_effects(escapes s.b => o.a.i)
func foo2(_ s: Str, o: inout Str) {
  o.a.i = s.b
}
```

### `@_effects(escaping <from-selection> -> <to-selection>)`

This variant of an escaping effect defines a "non-exclusive" escape. This means
that not only the _from-selection_, but also other values
can escape to the _to-selection_.

For example:

```swift
var g: Class

@_effects(escapes s.b -> return)
func foo1(_ s: Str, _ cond: Bool) -> Class {
  return cond ? s.b : g
}
```

## `@_exported`

Re-exports all declarations from an imported module.

This attribute is most commonly used by overlays.

```swift
// module M
public func f() {}

// module N
@_exported import M

// module P
import N
func g() {
  N.f() // OK
}
```

## `@_expose(<language>)`

Indicates that a particular declaration should be included
in the emitted specified foreign language binding.

When applied to a nominal type declaration, all of the
public declarations inside this type become exposed as well.

### `_expose(Cxx[, <"cxxName">])`

Indicates that a particular declaration should be included
in the generated C++ binding header.

The optional "cxxName" string will be used as the name of
the generated C++ declaration.

### `_expose(wasm[, <"wasmExportName">])`

Indicates that a particular function declaration should be
exported from the linked WebAssembly.

The optional "wasmExportName" string will be used as the
the export name.

It's the equivalent of clang's `__attribute__((export_name))`.

## `@_extern(<language>)`

Indicates that a particular declaration should be imported
from the external environment.

### `@_extern(wasm, module: <"moduleName">, name: <"fieldName">)`

Indicates that a particular declaration should be imported
through WebAssembly's import interface.

It's the equivalent of clang's `__attribute__((import_module("module"), import_name("field")))`.

### `@_extern(c, [, <"cName">])`

Indicates that a particular declaration should refer to a
C declaration with the given name. If the optional "cName"
string is not specified, the Swift function name is used
without Swift name mangling. Platform-specific mangling
rules (leading underscore on Darwin) are still applied.

Similar to `@_cdecl`, but this attribute is used to reference
C declarations from Swift, while `@_cdecl` is used to define
Swift functions that can be referenced from C.

Also similar to `@_silgen_name`, but a function declared with
`@_extern(c)` is assumed to use the C ABI, while `@_silgen_name`
assumes the Swift ABI.

It is always better to refer to C declarations by importing their
native declarations from a header or module using Swift's C interop
support when possible.

## `@_fixed_layout`

Same as `@frozen` but also works for classes.

With `@_fixed_layout` classes, vtable layout still happens dynamically, so
non-public virtual methods can be removed, new virtual methods can be added,
and existing virtual methods can be reordered.

## `@_hasInitialValue`

Marks that a property has an initializing expression.

This information is lost in the swiftinterface,
but it is required as it results in a symbol for the initializer
(if a class/struct `init` is inlined, it will call initializers
for properties that it doesn't initialize itself).
This information is necessary for correct TBD file generation.

## `@_hasMissingDesignatedInitializers`

Indicates that there may be designated initializers that are
not printed in the swiftinterface file for a particular class.

This attribute is needed for the initializer model to maintain correctness when
[library evolution](/docs/LibraryEvolution.rst) is enabled. This is because a
class may have non-public designated initializers, and Swift allows the
inheritance of convenience initializers if and only if the subclass overrides
(or has synthesized overrides) of every designated initializer in its
superclass. Consider the following code:

```swift
// Lib.swift
open class A {
  init(invisible: ()) {}

  public init(visible: ()) {}
  public convenience init(hi: ()) { self.init(invisible: ()) }
}

// Client.swift
class B : A {
  var x: String

  public override init(visible: ()) {
    self.x = "Garbage"
    super.init(visible: ())
  }
}
```

In this case, if `B` were allowed to inherit the convenience initializer
`A.init(invisible:)` then an instance created via `B(hi: ())` would fail
to initialize `B.x` resulting in a memory safety hole. What's worse is
there is no way to close this safety hole because the user cannot override
the invisible designated initializer because they lack sufficient visibility.

## `@_hasStorage`

Marks a property as being a stored property in a swiftinterface.

For `@frozen` types, the compiler needs to be able to tell whether a particular
property is stored or computed to correctly perform type layout.

```swift
@frozen struct S {
  @_hasStorage var x: Int { get set } // stored
  var y: Int { get set } // computed
}
```

## `@_implementationOnly`

Used to mark an imported module as an implementation detail.
This prevents types from that module being exposed in API
(types of public functions, constraints in public extension etc.)
and ABI (usage in `@inlinable` code).

## `@_spiOnly`

Marks an import to be used in SPI and implementation details only.
The import statement will be printed in the private swiftinterface only and
skipped in the public swiftinterface. Any use of imported types and decls in API
will be diagnosed.
Requires setting the frontend flag `-experimental-spi-only-imports`.

## `@_implements(ProtocolName, Requirement)`

An attribute that indicates that a function with one name satisfies
a protocol requirement with a different name. This is especially useful
when two protocols declare a requirement with the same name, but the
conforming type wishes to offer two separate implementations.

```swift
protocol P { func foo() }

protocol Q { func foo() }

struct S : P, Q {
  @_implements(P, foo())
  func foo_p() {}
  @_implements(Q, foo())
  func foo_q() {}
}
```

## `@_implicitSelfCapture`

Allows access to `self` inside a closure without explicitly capturing it,
even when `Self` is a reference type.

```swift
class C {
  func f() {}
  func g(_: @escaping () -> Void) {
    g({ f() }) // error: call to method 'f' in closure requires explicit use of 'self'
  }
  func h(@_implicitSelfCapture _: @escaping () -> Void) {
    h({ f() }) // ok
  }
}
```

## `@_inheritActorContext`

(Note that it is "inherit", not "inherits", unlike below.)

Marks that a `@Sendable async` or `sendable async` closure argument should
inherit the actor context (i.e. what actor it should be run on) based on the
declaration site of the closure rather than be non-Sendable. This does not do
anything if the closure is synchronous.

This works with global actors as expected:

```swift 
@MainActor
func test() {
  Task { /* main actor isolated */ }
}
```

However, for the inference to work with instance actors (i.e. `isolated` parameters),
the closure must capture the isolated parameter explicitly:

```swift 
func test(actor: isolated (any Actor)) {
  Task { /* non isolated */ } // !!!
}

func test(actor: isolated (any Actor)) {
  Task { // @_inheritActorContext
    _ = actor // 'actor'-isolated 
  }
}
```

The attribute takes an optional modifier '`always`', which changes this behavior 
and *always* captures the enclosing isolated context, rather than forcing developers
to perform the explicit capture themselfes:

```swift
func test(actor: isolated (any Actor)) {
  Task.immediate { // @_inheritActorContext(always)
    // 'actor'-isolated!
    // (without having to capture 'actor explicitly')
  }
}
```

DISCUSSION: The reason why this does nothing when the closure is synchronous is
since it does not have the ability to hop to the appropriate executor before it
is run, so we may create concurrency errors.

## `@_inheritsConvenienceInitializers`

An attribute that signals that a class declaration inherits its convenience
initializers from its superclass. This implies that all designated initializers
-- even those that may not be visible in a swiftinterface file -- are
overridden. This attribute is often printed alongside
`@_hasMissingDesignatedInitializers` in this case.

## `@inline(__always)`

Forces the function to be inlined.

If it's not possible to always inline the function, e.g. if it's a self-
recursive function, the attribute is ignored.

This attribute has no effect in debug builds.

## `@_lexicalLifetimes`

Applies lexical lifetime rules within a module built with lexical lifetimes
disabled.  Facilitates gradual migration.

In modules built with lexical lifetimes disabled but lexical borrow scopes
enabled--the behavior of `-enable-lexical-lifetimes=false`--all lexical markers
are stripped by the LexicalLifetimeEliminator pass.  Functions annotated with
this attribute keep their lexical markers, affecting the optimizations that run
on the function subsequently.

## `@_noEagerMove`

When applied to a value, indicates that the value's lifetime is lexical, that
releases of the value may not be hoisted over deinit barriers.  

This is the default behavior, unless the value's type is annotated
`@_eagerMove`, in which case this attribute overrides that type-level
annotation.

When applied to a type, indicates that all values which are instances of that
type are themselves `@_noEagerMove` as above.

This is the default behavior, unless the type annotated is an aggregate that
consists entirely of `@_eagerMove` or trivial values, in which case the
attribute overrides the inferred type-level annotation.

## `@_nonEscapable`

Indicates that a type is non-escapable. All instances of this type are
non-escaping values. A non-escaping value's lifetime must be confined
to another "parent" lifetime.

This is temporary until ~Escapable syntax is supported, which will
also work as a generic type constraint.

## `@_marker`

Indicates that a protocol is a marker protocol. Marker protocols represent some
meaningful property at compile-time but have no runtime representation.

For more details, see [SE-0302](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0302-concurrent-value-and-concurrent-closures.md#marker-protocols), which introduces marker protocols.
At the moment, the language only has one marker protocol: `Sendable`.

Fun fact: Rust has a very similar concept called
[marker traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/index.html),
including one called `Send`,
which inspired the design of `Sendable`.

## `@_noAllocation`, `@_noLocks`

These attributes are performance annotations. If a function is annotated with
such an attribute, the compiler issues a diagnostic message if the function
calls a runtime function which allocates memory or locks, respectively.
The `@_noLocks` attribute implies `@_noAllocation` because a memory allocation
also locks.

## `@_noImplicitCopy`

Marks a var decl as a variable that must be copied explicitly using the builtin
function Builtin.copy.

## `@_nonEphemeral`

Marks a function parameter that cannot accept a temporary pointer produced from
an inout-to-pointer, array-to-pointer, or string-to-pointer conversion. Such a
parameter may only accept a pointer that is guaranteed to outlive the duration
of the function call.

Attempting to pass a temporary pointer to an `@_nonEphemeral` parameter will
produce a warning. This attribute is primarily used within the standard library
on the various `UnsafePointer` initializers to warn users about
the undefined behavior caused by using a temporary pointer conversion as an
argument:

```swift
func baz() {
  var x = 0

  // warning: Initialization of 'UnsafePointer<Int>' results in a dangling pointer
  let ptr = UnsafePointer(&x)

  // warning: Initialization of 'UnsafePointer<Int>' results in a dangling pointer
  let ptr2 = UnsafePointer([1, 2, 3])
}
```

The temporary pointer conversion produces a pointer that is only
guaranteed to be valid for the duration of the call to the initializer,
and becomes invalid once the call ends.
So the newly created `UnsafePointer` will be dangling.

One exception to this is that inout-to-pointer conversions
on static stored properties and global stored properties
produce non-ephemeral pointers, as long as they have no observers:

```swift
var global = 0

struct S {
  static var staticVar = 0
}

func baz() {
  let ptr = UnsafePointer(&global) // okay
  let ptr2 = UnsafePointer(&S.staticVar) // okay
}
```

Additionally, if they are of a tuple or struct type, their stored members
without observers may also be passed inout as non-ephemeral pointers.

For more details, see the diagnostic group 
[temporary pointer usage](/userdocs/diagnostics/temporary-pointers.md).

## `@_nonoverride`

Marks a declaration that is not an override of another.
When the `-warn-implicit-overrides` flag is used, a warning is issued when a
protocol restates a requirement from another protocol it refines without
annotating the declaration with either `override` or `@_nonoverride`.

An `override` annotation causes the overriding declaration to be treated
identically to the overridden declaration; a conforming type can only
provide one implementation ("witness"). Restating a protocol requirement
and then marking it as an `override` is generally only needed to help
associated type inference, and many `override` annotations correlate
closely with ABI FIXMEs.

Meanwhile, `@_nonoverride` is the "opposite" of `override`, allowing two
protocol requirements to be treated independently; a conforming type can
provide a distinct witness for each requirement (for example, by using
`@_implements`). Use `@_nonoverride` when semantics differ between the
two requirements. For example, `BidirectionalCollection.index(_:offsetBy:)`
allows negative offsets, while `Collection.index(_:offsetBy:)` does not,
and therefore the former is marked `@_nonoverride`.

The `@_nonoverride` annotation can also be specified on class members in
addition to protocol members. Since it is the "opposite" of `override`, it can
be used to suppress "near-miss" diagnostics for declarations that are similar
to but not meant to override another declaration, and it can be used to
intentionally break the override chain, creating an overload instead of an
override.

This attribute and the corresponding `-warn-implicit-overrides` flag are
used when compiling the standard library and overlays.

## `@_nonSendable`

There is no clang attribute to add a Swift conformance to an imported type, but
there *is* a clang attribute to add a Swift attribute to an imported type. So
`@Sendable` (which is not normally allowed on types) is used from clang headers
to indicate that an unconstrained, fully available `Sendable` conformance should
be added to a given type, while `@_nonSendable` indicates that an unavailable
`Sendable` conformance should be added to it.

`@_nonSendable` can have no options after it, in which case it "beats"
`@Sendable` if both are applied to the same declaration, or it can have
`(_assumed)` after it, in which case `@Sendable` "beats" it.
`@_nonSendable(_assumed)` is intended to be used when mass-marking whole regions
of a header as non-`Sendable` so that you can make spot exceptions with
`@Sendable`.

## `@_objcImplementation(CategoryName)`

A pre-stable form of `@implementation`. The main difference between them is that
many things that are errors with `@implementation` are warnings with
`@_objcImplementation`, which permitted workarounds for compiler bugs and 
changes in compiler behavior.

Declares an extension that defines an implementation for the Objective-C
category `CategoryName` on the class in question, or for the main `@interface`
if the argument list is omitted.

This attribute is used to write fully Objective-C-compatible implementations in
Swift. Normal Objective-C interop allows Objective-C clients to use instances of
the subclass, but not to subclass them, and uses a generated header that is not
meant to be read by humans. `@_objcImplementation`, on the other hand, creates
classes that are virtually indistinguishable from classes implemented in native 
Objective-C: they do not have a Swift vtable or any other Swift-specific
metadata, Swift does not use any special knowledge of the class's "Swiftiness" 
when using the class so ObjC runtime calls work correctly and they can even be 
subclassed by Objective-C code, and you write a header for the class by hand 
that looks exactly like an equivalent ObjC class. Clients should not notice if 
you replace a native Objective-C `@implementation Foo (Bar)` with a Swift 
`@_objcImplementation(Bar) extension Foo`.

You create a class with this feature very differently from normal ObjC interop:

1. Hand-write headers that declare the class's Objective-C interface, just as
   you would for a native Objective-C class. Since you're handwriting these
   headers, you can write them just as you would for an Objective-C class:
   splitting them across multiple files, grouping related declarations together,
   adding comments, declaring Swift behavior using C attributes or API notes,
   etc.
   
2. Import your headers into Swift using a bridging header or umbrella header so
   Swift can see them.

3. Implement your class using a mixture of `@implementation` declarations in
   `.m` files and `@_objcImplementation extension`s in `.swift` files. Each
   `@interface` should have exactly one corresponding implementation; don't try
   to implement some members of a single `@interface` in ObjC and others in
   Swift.

   * To implement the main `@interface` of a class in Swift, use
     `@_objcImplementation extension ClassName`.
     
   * To implement a category in Swift, use
     `@_objcImplementation(CategoryName) extension ClassName`.
     
The members of an `@_objcImplementation` extension should fall into one of
three categories:
   
* **Swift-only members** include any member marked `final`. These are not
  `@objc` or `dynamic` and are only callable from Swift. Use these for
  Swift-only APIs, random helper methods, etc. 
    
* **ObjC helper members** include any non-`final` member marked `fileprivate`
  or `private`. These are implicitly `@objc dynamic`. Use these for action
  methods, selector-based callbacks, and other situations where you need a
  helper method to be accessible from an Objective-C message.
  
* **Member implementations** include any other non-`final` member. These are
  implicitly `@objc dynamic` and must match a member declared in the
  Objective-C header. Use these to implement the APIs declared in your
  headers. Swift will emit an error if these don't match your headers.

Notes:

* We don't currently plan to support ObjC generics.

* We should think about ObjC "direct" members, but that would probably
  require a way to spell this in Swift. 

## `@_objc_non_lazy_realization`

Marks a class as being non-lazily (i.e. eagerly) [realized](/docs/Lexicon.md#realization).

This is used for declarations which may be statically referenced and wouldn't
go through the normal lazy realization paths. For example, the empty array
class must be non-lazily realized, because empty arrays are statically
allocated. Otherwise, passing the empty array object to other code without
triggering realization could allow for the unrealized empty array class to be
passed to ObjC runtime APIs which only operate on realized classes, resulting
in a crash.

## `@_optimize([none|size|speed])`

Controls the compiler's optimization mode. This attribute is analogous to the
command-line flags `-Onone`, `-Osize` and `-Ospeed` respectively, but limited
to a single function body.

`@_optimize(none)` is handy for diagnosing and reducing compiler bugs as well
as improving debugging in Release builds.

## `@_originallyDefinedIn(module: "ModuleName", availabilitySpec...)`

Marks a declaration as being originally defined in a different module,
changing the name mangling. This can be used to move declarations
from a module to one of the modules it imports without breaking clients.

Consider the following example where a framework ToasterKit needs
to move some APIs to a lower-level framework ToasterKitCore.
Here are the necessary changes:

1. Add a linker flag `-reexport_framework ToasterKitCore` for ToasterKit.
   This ensures all symbols defined in ToasterKitCore will be accessible during
   runtime via ToasterKit, so existing apps continue to run.
2. In ToasterKit, use `@_exported import ToasterKitCore`.
   This ensures existing source code that only imports ToasterKit continues to
   type-check.
3. Move the necessary declarations from ToasterKit to ToasterKitCore.
   The moved declaration should have two attributes:
   - `@available` indicating when the declaration was introduced in ToasterKit.
   - `@_originallyDefinedIn` indicating the original module and when the
     declaration was moved to ToasterKitCore.
   ```swift
   @available(toasterOS 42, *)
   @_originallyDefinedIn(module: "ToasterKit", toasterOS 57)
   enum Toast {
   case underdone
   case perfect
   case burnt
   }
   ```
4. Add Swift compiler flags `-Xfrontend -emit-ldadd-cfile-path -Xfrontend /tmp/t.c`
   to ToasterKitCore's build settings. Add the emitted `/tmp/t.c` file to
   ToasterKit's compilation.
   This ensures when an app is built for deployment targets prior to the symbols' move,
   the app will look for these symbols in ToasterKit instead of ToasterKitCore.

More generally, multiple availabilities can be specified, like so:

```swift
@available(toasterOS 42, bowlOS 54, mugOS 54, *)
@_originallyDefinedIn(module: "ToasterKit", toasterOS 57, bowlOS 69, mugOS 69)
enum Toast { ... }
```

## `@_preInverseGenerics`

By default when mangling a generic signature, the presence of a conformance 
requirement for an invertible protocol, like Copyable and Escapable, is not
explicitly mangled. Only the _absence_ of those conformance requirements for
each generic parameter appears in the mangled name.

This attribute changes the way generic signatures are mangled, by ignoring
even the absences of those conformance requirements for invertible protocols.
So, the following functions would have the same mangling because of the
attribute:

```swift
@_preInverseGenerics
func foo<T: ~Copyable>(_ t: borrowing T) {}

// In 'bug.swift', the function above without the attribute would be:
//
//   $s3bug3fooyyxRi_zlF ---> bug.foo<A where A: ~Swift.Copyable>(A) -> ()
//
// With the attribute, the above becomes:
//
//   $s3bug3fooyyxlF ---> bug.foo<A>(A) -> ()
//
// which is exactly the same symbol for the function below.

func foo<T>(_ t: T) {}
```

The purpose of this attribute is to aid in adopting noncopyable generics
(SE-427) in existing libraries without breaking ABI; it is for advanced users
only.

> **WARNING:** Before applying this attribute, you _must manually verify_ that
> there never were any implementations of `foo` that contained a copy of `t`, 
> to ensure correctness. There is no way to prove this by simply inspecting the
> Swift source code! You actually have to **check the assembly code** in all of
> your existing libraries containing `foo`, because an older version of the
> Swift compiler could have decided to insert a copy of `t` as an optimization!

## `@_private(sourceFile: "FileName.swift")`

Fully bypasses access control, allowing access to private declarations
in the imported module. The imported module needs to be compiled with
`-Xfrontend -enable-private-imports` for this to work.

## `@_rawLayout(...)`

Specifies the declared type consists of raw storage. The type must be
noncopyable, and declare no stored properties.
Raw storage is left almost entirely unmanaged by the language, and so
can be used as storage for data structures with nonstandard access patterns
including atomics and many kinds of locks such as `os_unfair_lock` on Darwin
or `futex` on Linux, to replicate the behavior of things
like C++'s `mutable` fields or Rust's `Cell<T>` type which allow for mutation
in typically immutable contexts, and/or to provide inline storage for data
structures that may be conditionally initialized, such as a "small vector"
which stores up to N elements in inline storage but spills into heap allocation
past a threshold.

Programmers can safely make the following assumptions about
the memory of the annotated type:

- A value has a **stable address** until it is either consumed or moved.
  No value of any type in Swift can ever be moved while it is being borrowed or
  mutated, so for a `@_rawLayout` type, the address of `self` within a
  `borrowing` or `mutating` method cannot change within the function body, and
  the same is true more generally for the address of any `@_rawLayout` typed
  parameter that is `borrowing` or `mutating` in any function or method.
  Values that appear in a global variable or class stored property can never be
  moved, and can only be consumed by the deallocation of the containing object
  instance, so effectively has a stable address for their entire lifetime.
- A value's memory **may be read and mutated at any time** independent of
  formal accesses. In particular, pointers into the storage may be "escaped"
  outside of scopes where the address is statically guaranteed to be stable,
  and those pointers may be used freely for as long as the storage dynamically
  isn't consumed or moved. It becomes the programmer's responsibility in this
  case to ensure that reads and writes to the storage do not race across
  threads, writes don't overlap with reads or writes coming from the same
  thread, and that the pointer is not used after the value is moved or
  consumed.
- By default, when the value is moved a bitwise copy of its memory is performed
  to the new address of the value in its new owner. This makes it unsuitable to
  store not bitwise-movable types such as nontrivial C++ types, Objective-C weak
  references, and data structures such as `pthread_mutex_t` which are
  implemented in C as always requiring a fixed address. However, you can provide
  `movesAsLike` to the `like:` version of this attribute to enforce that moving
  the value will defer its move semantics to the type it's like. This makes it
  suitable for storing such values that are not bitwise-movable. Note that the
  raw storage for this variant must always be properly initialized after
  initialization because foreign moves will assume an initialized state.

Using the `@_rawLayout` attribute will suppress the annotated type from
being implicitly `Sendable`. If the type is safe to access across threads, it
may be declared to conform to `@unchecked Sendable`, with the usual level
of programmer-assumed responsibility that involves. This generally means that
any mutations must be done atomically or with a lock guard, and if the storage
is ever mutated, then any reads of potentially-mutated state within the storage
must also be atomic or lock-guarded, because the storage may be accessed
simultaneously by multiple threads.

A non-Sendable type's memory will be confined to accesses from a single thread
or task; however, since most mutating operations in Swift still expect
exclusivity while executing, a programmer must ensure that overlapping
mutations cannot occur from aliasing, recursion, reentrancy, signal handlers, or
other potential sources of overlapping access within the same thread.

The parameters to the attribute specify the layout of the type. The following
forms are currently accepted:

- `@_rawLayout(size: N, alignment: M)` specifies the type's size and alignment
  in bytes.
- `@_rawLayout(like: T(, movesAsLike))` specifies the type's size and alignment
  should be equal to the type `T`'s. An optional `movesAsLike` parameter can be
  passed to guarantee that moving a value of this raw layout type will have the
  same move semantics as the type it's like. This is important for things like
  ObjC weak references and non-trivial move constructors in C++.
- `@_rawLayout(likeArrayOf: T, count: N(, movesAsLike))` specifies the type's
  size should be `MemoryLayout<T>.stride * N` and alignment should match `T`'s,
  like an array of N contiguous elements of `T` in memory. An optional
  `movesAsLike` parameter can be passed to guarantee that moving a value of this
  raw layout type will have the same move semantics as the type it's like. This
  is important for things like ObjC weak references and non-trivial move
  constructors in C++.

A notable difference between `@_rawLayout(like: T)` and
`@_rawLayout(likeArrayOf: T, count: 1)` is that the latter will pad out the
size of the raw storage to include the full stride of the single element.
This ensures that the buffer can be safely used with bulk array operations
despite containing only a single element. `@_rawLayout(like: T)` by contrast
will exactly match the size and stride of the original type `T`, allowing for
other values to be stored in the tail padding when the raw layout type appears
in a larger aggregate.

```swift
// struct Weird has size 5, stride 8, alignment 4
struct Weird {
    var x: Int32
    var y: Int8
}

// struct LikeWeird has size 5, stride 8, alignment 4
@_rawLayout(like: Weird)
struct LikeWeird { }

// struct LikeWeirdSingleArray has **size 8**, stride 8, alignment 4
@_rawLayout(likeArrayOf: Weird, count: 1)
struct LikeWeirdSingleArray { }
```

Although the `like:` and `likeArrayOf:count:` forms will produce raw storage
with the size and alignment of another type, the memory is **not** implicitly
*bound* to that type, as *bound* is defined by `UnsafePointer` and
`UnsafeMutablePointer`. The memory can be accessed as raw memory
if it is never explicitly bound using a typed pointer method like
`withMemoryRebound(to:)` or `bindMemory(to:)`. However, if the raw memory is
bound, it must only be used with compatible typed memory accesses for as long
as the binding is active.

## `@_section("section_name")`

Places a global variable or a top-level function into a section of the object
file with the given name. It's the equivalent of clang's
`__attribute__((section))`.

## `@_semantics("uniquely.recognized.id")`

Allows the optimizer to make use of some key invariants in performance critical
data types, especially `Array`. Since the implementation of these data types
is written in Swift using unsafe APIs, without these attributes the optimizer
would need to make conservative assumptions.

Changing the implementation in a way that violates the optimizer's assumptions
about the semantics results in undefined behavior.

## `@_show_in_interface`

Shows underscored protocols from the standard library in the generated interface.

By default, SourceKit hides underscored protocols from the generated
swiftinterface (for all modules, not just the standard library), but this
attribute can be used to override that behavior for the standard library.

## `@_silgen_name([raw: ]"cName")`

Changes the symbol name for a function or a global, similar to an ASM label in
C. Unlike ASM labels in C, the platform symbol mangling (leading underscore on
Darwin) is maintained, unless "raw:" is used, in which case the name provided is
expected to already be mangled.

Since this has label-like behavior, it may not correspond to any declaration;
if so, it is assumed that the function/global is implemented possibly
in some other language; that implementation however is assumed to use
the Swift ABI as if it were defined in Swift.

There are very few legitimate uses for this attribute. There are many
ways to misuse it:

- Don't use `@_silgen_name` to access C functions, since those use the C ABI.
  Import a header or C module to access C functions.
- Don't use `@_silgen_name` to export Swift functions to C/ObjC. `@_cdecl` or
  `@objc` can do that.
- Don't use `@_silgen_name` to link to `swift_*` symbols from the Swift runtime.
  Calls to these functions have special semantics to the compiler, and accessing
  them directly will lead to unpredictable compiler crashes and undefined
  behavior. Use language features, or if you must, the `Builtin` module, instead.
- Don't use `@_silgen_name` for dynamic linker discovery. Swift symbols cannot
  be reliably recovered through C interfaces like `dlsym`. If you want to
  implement a plugin-style interface, use `Bundle`/`NSBundle` if available, or
  export your plugin entry points as C entry points using `@_cdecl`.
  
Legitimate uses may include:

- Use `@_silgen_name` if you're implementing the Swift runtime.
- Use `@_silgen_name` if you need to make a change to an ABI-stable
  declaration's signature that would normally alter its mangled name, but you
  need to preserve the old mangled name for ABI compatibility. You will need
  to be careful that the change doesn't materially affect the actual calling
  convention of the function in an incompatible way.
- Use `@_silgen_name` if certain declarations need to have predictable symbol
  names, such as to be easily referenced by linker scripts or other highly
  customized build environments (and it's OK for those predictable symbols to
  reference functions with a Swift ABI).
- Use `@_silgen_name` to interface build products that must be linked
  together but built completely separately, such that one can't import the other
  normally. For this to work, the declaration(s) and definition must exactly
  match, using the exact same definitions of any referenced types or other
  declarations. The compiler can't help you if you mismatch.

For more details, see the
[Standard Library Programmer's Manual](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/blob/main/docs/StandardLibraryProgrammersManual.md#_silgen_name).

## `@_specialize(...)`

Forces generation of a specialized implementation for a generic declaration.

See [Generics.rst](/docs/archive/Generics.rst) for more details.

## `@_specializeExtension`

Allows extending `@usableFromInline` internal types from foreign modules.
Consider the following example involving two modules:

```swift
// Module A
@usableFromInline
internal struct S<T> { /* ... */ }

// Module B
import A

@_specializeExtension
extension S { // OK
  // add methods here
}

extension S /* or A.S */ { // error: cannot find 'S' in scope
}
```

This ability can be used to add specializations of existing methods
in downstream libraries when used in conjunction with `@_specialize`.

```swift
// Module A
@usableFromInline
internal struct S<T> {
  @inlinable
  internal func doIt() { /* body */ }
}

// Module B
import A

@_specializeExtension
extension S { // ok
  @_specialize(exported: true, target: doIt(), where T == Int)
  public func specializedDoIt() {}
}

// Module C
import A
import B

func f(_ s: S<Int>) {
  s.doIt() // will call specialized version of doIt() where T == Int from B
}
```

## `@_spi(spiName)`

Marks a declaration as SPI (System Programming Interface), instead of API.
Modules exposing SPI and using library evolution generate an additional
`.private.swiftinterface` file (with `-emit-private-module-interface-path`)
in addition to the usual `.swiftinterface` file. This private interface exposes
both API and SPI.

Clients can access SPI by marking the import as `@_spi(spiName) import Module`.
This design makes it easy to find out which clients are using certain SPIs by
doing a textual search.

## `@_spi_available(platform, version)`

Like `@available`, this attribute indicates a decl is available only as an SPI.
This implies several behavioral changes comparing to regular `@available`:
1. Type checker diagnoses when a client accidentally exposes such a symbol in library APIs.
2. When emitting public interfaces, `@_spi_available` is printed as `@available(platform, unavailable)`.
3. ClangImporter imports ObjC macros `SPI_AVAILABLE` and `__SPI_AVAILABLE` to this attribute.

## `@_staticInitializeObjCMetadata`

Indicates that a static initializer should be emitted to register the
Objective-C metadata when the image is loaded, rather than on first use of the
Objective-C metadata.

This attribute is inferred for `NSCoding` classes that won't
have static Objective-C metadata or have an `@NSKeyedArchiveLegacy` attribute.

## `@_transparent`

Marks a function to be "macro-like", i.e., it is guaranteed to be inlined
in debug builds.

See [TransparentAttr.md](/docs/TransparentAttr.md) for more details.

## `@_typeEraser(Proto)`

Marks a concrete nominal type as one that implements type erasure for a
protocol `Proto`.

A type eraser has the following restrictions:

1. It must be a concrete nominal type.
2. It must not have more restrictive access than `Proto`.
3. It must conform to `Proto`.
4. It must have an initializer of the form `init<T: Proto>(erasing: T)`.
  - Other generic requirements are permitted as long as the `init` can always
    be called with a value of any type conforming to `Proto`.
  - The `init` cannot have more restrictive access than `Proto`.

This feature was designed to be used for compiler-driven type erasure for
dynamic replacement of functions with an opaque return type.

## `@_unavailableFromAsync`

Marks a synchronous API as being unavailable from asynchronous contexts. Direct
usage of annotated API from asynchronous contexts will result in a warning from
the compiler.

## `@_unsafeMainActor`, `@_unsafeSendable`

Marks a parameter's (function) type as `@MainActor` (`@Sendable`) in Swift 6 and
within Swift 5 code that has adopted concurrency, but non-`@MainActor`
(non-`@Sendable`) everywhere else.

See the forum post on [Concurrency in Swift 5 and 6](https://forums.swift.org/t/concurrency-in-swift-5-and-6/49337)
for more details.

## `@_unsafeInheritExecutor`

This `async` function uses the pre-SE-0338 semantics of unsafely inheriting the caller's executor.  This is an underscored feature because the right way of inheriting an executor is to pass in the required executor and switch to it.  Unfortunately, there are functions in the standard library which need to inherit their caller's executor but cannot change their ABI because they were not defined as `@_alwaysEmitIntoClient` in the initial release.

## `@_used`

Marks a global variable or a top-level function as "used externally" even if it
does not have visible users in the compilation unit. It's the equivalent of
clang's `__attribute__((used))`.

## `@_weakLinked`

Allows a declaration to be weakly-referenced, i.e., any references emitted by
client modules to the declaration's symbol will have weak linkage. This means
that client code will compile without the guarantee that the symbol will be
available at runtime. This requires a dynamic safety check (such as using
`dlsym (3)`); otherwise, accessing the symbol when it is unavailable leads
to a runtime crash.

This is an unsafe alternative to using `@available`, which is statically checked.
If the availability of a library symbol is newer than the deployment target of
the client, the symbol will be weakly linked, but checking for `@available` and
`#(un)available` ensures that a symbol is not accessed when it is unavailable.

## `_local`

A distributed actor can be marked as "known to be local" which allows avoiding 
the distributed actor isolation checks. This is used for things like `whenLocal`
where the actor passed to the closure is known-to-be-local, and similarly a 
`self` of obtained from an _isolated_ function inside a distributed actor is 
also guaranteed to be local by construction.
