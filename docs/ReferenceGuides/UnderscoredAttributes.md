# Underscored Attributes Reference

**WARNING:** This information is provided primarily for compiler and standard
library developers. Usage of these attributes outside of the Swift monorepo
is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.

The Swift reference has a chapter discussing [stable attributes][Attributes].
This document is intended to serve as a counterpart describing underscored
attributes, whose semantics are subject to change and most likely need to
go through the Swift evolution process before being stabilized.

[Attributes]: https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Attributes.html

The attributes are organized in alphabetical order.

## `@_alignment(numericValue)`

Allows controlling the alignment of a type.

The alignment value specified must be a power of two, and cannot be less
than the "natural" alignment of the type that would otherwise be used by
the Swift ABI. This attribute is intended for the SIMD types in the standard
library which use it to increase the alignment of their internal storage to at
least 16 bytes.

## `@_alwaysEmitIntoClient`

Forces the body of a function to be emitted into client code.

Note that this is distinct from `@inline(__always)`; it doesn't force inlining
at call-sites, it only means that the implementation is compiled into the
module which uses the code.

This means that `@_alwaysEmitIntoClient` definitions are _not_ part of the
defining module's ABI, so changing the implementation at a later stage
does not break ABI.

Most notably, default argument expressions are implicitly
`@_alwaysEmitIntoClient`, which means that adding a default argument to a
function which did not have one previously does not break ABI.

## `@_borrowed`

Indicates that the [conservative access pattern](/docs/Lexicon.md#access-pattern)
for some storage (a subscript or a property) should use the `_read` accessor
instead of `get`.

For more details, see the forum post on
[Value ownership when reading from a storage declaration](https://forums.swift.org/t/value-ownership-when-reading-from-a-storage-declaration/15076).

## `@_cdecl("cName")`

Similar to `@_silgen_name` but uses the C calling convention.

This attribute doesn't have very well-defined semantics. Type bridging is not
done, so the parameter and return types should correspond directly to types
accessible in C. In most cases, it is preferable to define a static method
on an `@objc` class instead of using `@_cdecl`.

For potential ideas on stabilization, see
[Formalizing `@cdecl`](https://forums.swift.org/t/formalizing-cdecl/40677).

## `@_disfavoredOverload`

Marks an overload that the type checker should try to avoid using. When the
expression type checker is considering overloads, it will prefer a solution
with fewer `@_disfavoredOverload` declarations over one with more of them.

Use `@_disfavoredOverload` to work around known bugs in the overload
resolution rules that cannot be immediately fixed without a source break.
Don't use it to adjust overload resolution rules that are otherwise sensible
but happen to produce undesirable results for your particular API; it will
likely be removed or made into a no-op eventually, and then you will be
stuck with an overload set that cannot be made to function in the way
you intend.

`@_disfavoredOverload` was first introduced to work around a bug in overload
resolution with `ExpressibleByXYZLiteral` types. The type checker strongly
prefers to give literals their default type (e.g. `Int` for
`ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral`, `String` for `ExpressibleByStringLiteral`,
etc.). If an API should prefer some other type, but accept the default too,
 marking the declaration taking the default type with `@_disfavoredOverload`
 gives the desired behavior:

```swift
extension LocalizedStringKey: ExpressibleByStringLiteral { ... }

extension Text {
  // We want `Text("foo")` to use this initializer:
  init(_ key: LocalizedStringKey) { ... }

  // But without @_disfavoredOverload, it would use this one instead,
  // because that lets it give the literal its default type:
  @_disfavoredOverload init<S: StringProtocol>(_ str: S) { ... }
}
```

## `@_dynamicReplacement(for:)`

Marks a function as the dynamic replacement for another `dynamic` function.
This is similar to method swizzling in other languages such as Objective-C,
except that the replacement happens at program start (or loading a shared
library), instead of at an arbitrary point in time.

For more details, see the forum post on
[Dynamic method replacement](https://forums.swift.org/t/dynamic-method-replacement/16619).

## `@_distributedActorIndependent`

Marks a specific property of a distributed actor to be available even if the
actor is remote.

This only applies to two distributed actor properties `address` and `transport`.
It cannot be safely declared on any properties defined by ordinary Swift code.

## `@_effects(effectname)`

Tells the compiler that the implementation of the defined function is limited
to certain side effects. The attribute argument specifies the kind of side
effect limitations that apply to the function including any other functions
it calls. This is used to provide information to the optimizer that it can't
already infer from static analysis.

Changing the implementation in a way that violates the optimizer's assumptions
about the effects results in undefined behavior.

For more details, see [OptimizerEffects.rst](/docs/Proposals/OptimizerEffects.rst).

## `@_exported`

Re-exports all declarations from an imported module.

This attribute is most commonly used by overlays.

```swift
// module M
func f() {}

// module N
@_exported import M

// module P
import N
func g() {
  N.f() // OK
}
```

## `@_fixed_layout`

Same as `@frozen` but also works for classes.

With `@_fixed_layout` classes, vtable layout still happens dynamically, so
non-public virtual methods can be removed, new virtual methods can be added,
and existing virtual methods can be reordered.

## `@_hasInitialValue`

Marks that a property has an initializing expression.

This information is lost in the swiftinterface,
but it is required as it results in a symbol for the initializer
(if a class/struct `init` is inlined, it will call initializers
for properties that it doesn't initialize itself).
This information is necessary for correct TBD file generation.

## `@_hasMissingDesignatedInitializers`

Indicates that there may be designated initializers that are
not printed in the swiftinterface file for a particular class.

This attribute is needed for the initializer model to maintain correctness when
[library evolution](/docs/LibraryEvolution.rst) is enabled. This is because a
class may have non-public designated initializers, and Swift allows the
inheritance of convenience initializers if and only if the subclass overrides
(or has synthesized overrides) of every designated initializer in its
superclass. Consider the following code:

```swift
// Lib.swift
open class A {
  init(invisible: ()) {}

  public init(visible: ()) {}
  public convenience init(hi: ()) { self.init(invisible: ()) }
}

// Client.swift
class B : A {
  var x: String

  public override init(visible: ()) {
    self.x = "Garbage"
    super.init(visible: ())
  }
}
```

In this case, if `B` were allowed to inherit the convenience initializer
`A.init(invisible:)` then an instance created via `B(hi: ())` would fail
to initialize `B.x` resulting in a memory safety hole. What's worse is
there is no way to close this safety hole because the user cannot override
the invisible designated initializer because they lack sufficient visibility.

## `@_hasStorage`

Marks a property as being a stored property in a swiftinterface.

For `@frozen` types, the compiler needs to be able to tell whether a particular
property is stored or computed to correctly perform type layout.

```swift
@frozen struct S {
  @_hasStorage var x: Int { get set } // stored
  var y: Int { get set } // computed
}
```

## `@_implementationOnly`

Used to mark an imported module as an implementation detail.
This prevents types from that module being exposed in API
(types of public functions, constraints in public extension etc.)
and ABI (usage in `@inlinable` code).

## `@_implements(ProtocolName, Requirement)`

An attribute that indicates that a function with one name satisfies
a protocol requirement with a different name. This is especially useful
when two protocols declare a requirement with the same name, but the
conforming type wishes to offer two separate implementations.

```swift
protocol P { func foo() }

protocol Q { func foo() }

struct S : P, Q {
  @_implements(P, foo())
  func foo_p() {}
  @_implements(Q, foo())
  func foo_q() {}
}
```

## `@_implicitSelfCapture`

Allows access to `self` inside a closure without explicitly capturing it,
even when `Self` is a reference type.

```swift
class C {
  func f() {}
  func g(_: @escaping () -> Void {
    g({ f() }) // error: call to method 'f' in closure requires explicit use of 'self'
  }
  func h(@_implicitSelfCapture _: @escaping () -> Void) {
    h({ f() }) // ok
  }
}
```

## `@_inheritActorContext`

(Note that it is "inherit", not "inherits", unlike below.)

Marks that a `@Sendable async` closure argument should inherited the actor
context (i.e. what actor it should be run on) based on the declaration site
of the closure. This is different from the typical behavior, where the closure
may be runnable anywhere unless its type specifically declares that it will
run on a specific actor.

This new attribute can be used on parameters of `@Sendable async` type
to indicate that the closures arguments passed to such parameters
should inherit the actor context where they are formed, which is not
the normal behavior for `@Sendable` closures.

## `@_inheritsConvenienceInitializers`

An attribute that signals that a class declaration inherits its convenience
initializers from its superclass. This implies that all designated initializers
-- even those that may not be visible in a swiftinterface file -- are
overridden. This attribute is often printed alongside
`@_hasMissingDesignatedInitializers` in this case.

## `@_marker`

Indicates that a protocol is a marker protocol. Marker protocols represent some
meaningful property at compile-time but have no runtime representation.

For more details, see [SE-0302](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0302-concurrent-value-and-concurrent-closures.md#marker-protocols), which introduces marker protocols.

At the moment, the language only has one marker protocol: `Sendable`.

Fun fact: Rust has a very similar concept called
[marker traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/index.html),
including one called `Send`,
which inspired the design of `Sendable`.

## `@_nonEphemeral`

Marks a function parameter that cannot accept a temporary pointer produced from
an inout-to-pointer, array-to-pointer, or string-to-pointer conversion. Such a
parameter may only accept a pointer that is guaranteed to outlive the duration
of the function call.

Attempting to pass a temporary pointer to an `@_nonEphemeral` parameter will
produce a warning. This attribute is primarily used within the standard library
on the various `UnsafePointer` initializers to warn users about
the undefined behavior caused by using a temporary pointer conversion as an
argument:

```swift
func baz() {
  var x = 0

  // warning: Initialization of 'UnsafePointer<Int>' results in a dangling pointer
  let ptr = UnsafePointer(&x)

  // warning: Initialization of 'UnsafePointer<Int>' results in a dangling pointer
  let ptr2 = UnsafePointer([1, 2, 3])
}
```

The temporary pointer conversion produces a pointer that is only
guaranteed to be valid for the duration of the call to the initializer,
and becomes invalid once the call ends.
So the newly created `UnsafePointer` will be dangling.

One exception to this is that inout-to-pointer conversions
on static stored properties and global stored properties
produce non-ephemeral pointers, as long as they have no observers:

```swift
var global = 0

struct S {
  static var staticVar = 0
}

func baz() {
  let ptr = UnsafePointer(&global) // okay
  let ptr2 = UnsafePointer(&S.staticVar) // okay
}
```

Additionally, if they are of a tuple or struct type, their stored members
without observers may also be passed inout as non-ephemeral pointers.

For more details, see the educational note on
[temporary pointer usage](/userdocs/diagnostics/temporary-pointers.md).

## `@_nonoverride`

Marks a declaration that is not an override of another.
When the `-warn-implicit-overrides` flag is used, a warning is issued when a
protocol restates a requirement from another protocol it refines without
annotating the declaration with either `override` or `@_nonoverride`.

An `override` annotation causes the overriding declaration to be treated
identically to the overridden declaration; a conforming type can only
provide one implementation ("witness"). Restating a protocol requirement
and then marking it as an `override` is generally only needed to help
associated type inference, and many `override` annotations correlate
closely with ABI FIXMEs.

Meanwhile, `@_nonoverride` is the "opposite" of `override`, allowing two
protocol requirements to be treated independently; a conforming type can
provide a distinct witness for each requirement (for example, by using
`@_implements`). Use `@_nonoverride` when semantics differ between the
two requirements. For example, `BidirectionalCollection.index(_:offsetBy:)`
allows negative offsets, while `Collection.index(_:offsetBy:)` does not,
and therefore the former is marked `@_nonoverride`.

The `@_nonoverride` annotation can also be specified on class members in
addition to protocol members. Since it is the "opposite" of `override`, it can
be used to suppress "near-miss" diagnostics for declarations that are similar
to but not meant to override another declaration, and it can be used to
intentionally break the override chain, creating an overload instead of an
override.

This attribute and the corresponding `-warn-implicit-overrides` flag are
used when compiling the standard library and overlays.

## `@_objc_non_lazy_realization`

Marks a class as being non-lazily (i.e. eagerly) [realized](/docs/Lexicon.md#realization).

This is used for declarations which may be statically referenced and wouldn't
go through the normal lazy realization paths. For example, the empty array
class must be non-lazily realized, because empty arrays are statically
allocated. Otherwise, passing the empty array object to other code without
triggering realization could allow for the unrealized empty array class to be
passed to ObjC runtime APIs which only operate on realized classes, resulting
in a crash.

## `@_optimize([none|size|speed])`

Controls the compiler's optimization mode. This attribute is analogous to the
command-line flags `-Onone`, `-Osize` and `-Ospeed` respectively, but limited
to a single function body.

`@_optimize(none)` is handy for diagnosing and reducing compiler bugs as well
as improving debugging in Release builds.

## `@_originallyDefinedIn(module: "ModuleName", availabilitySpec...)`

Marks a declaration as being originally defined in a different module,
changing the name mangling. This can be used to move declarations
from a module to one of the modules it imports without breaking clients.

Consider the following example where a framework ToasterKit needs
to move some APIs to a lower-level framework ToasterKitCore.
Here are the necessary changes:

1. Add a linker flag `-reexport_framework ToasterKitCore` for ToasterKit.
   This ensures all symbols defined in ToasterKitCore will be accessible during
   runtime via ToasterKit, so existing apps continue to run.
2. In ToasterKit, use `@_exported import ToasterKitCore`.
   This ensures existing source code that only imports ToasterKit continues to
   type-check.
3. Move the necessary declarations from ToasterKit to ToasterKitCore.
   The moved declaration should have two attributes:
   - `@available` indicating when the declaration was introduced in ToasterKit.
   - `@_originallyDefinedIn` indicating the original module and when the
     declaration was moved to ToasterKitCore.
   ```swift
   @available(toasterOS 42, *)
   @_originallyDefinedIn(module: "ToasterKit", toasterOS 57)
   enum Toast {
   case underdone
   case perfect
   case burnt
   }
   ```
4. Add Swift compiler flags `-Xfrontend -emit-ldadd-cfile-path -Xfrontend /tmp/t.c`
   to ToasterKitCore's build settings. Add the emitted `/tmp/t.c` file to
   ToasterKit's compilation.
   This ensures when an app is built for deployment targets prior to the symbols' move,
   the app will look for these symbols in ToasterKit instead of ToasterKitCore.

More generally, mutliple availabilities can be specified, like so:

```swift
@available(toasterOS 42, bowlOS 54, mugOS 54, *)
@_originallyDefinedIn(module: "ToasterKit", toasterOS 57, bowlOS 69, mugOS 69)
enum Toast { ... }
```

## `@_private(sourceFile: "FileName.swift")`

Fully bypasses access control, allowing access to private declarations
in the imported module. The imported module needs to be compiled with
`-Xfrontend -enable-private-imports` for this to work.

## `@_semantics("uniquely.recognized.id")`

Allows the optimizer to make use of some key invariants in performance critical
data types, especially `Array`. Since the implementation of these data types
is written in Swift using unsafe APIs, without these attributes the optimizer
would need to make conservative assumptions.

Changing the implementation in a way that violates the optimizer's assumptions
about the semantics results in undefined behavior.

## `@_show_in_interface`

Shows underscored protocols from the standard library in the generated interface.

By default, SourceKit hides underscored protocols from the generated
swiftinterface (for all modules, not just the standard library), but this
attribute can be used to override that behavior for the standard library.

## `@_silgen_name("cName")`

Changes the symbol name for a function, similar to an ASM label in C,
except that the platform symbol mangling (leading underscore on Darwin)
is maintained.

Since this has label-like behavior, it may not correspond to any declaration;
if so, it is assumed that the function is implemented in C.

A function defined by `@_silgen_name` is assumed to use the Swift ABI.

For more details, see the
[Standard Library Programmer's Manual](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/StandardLibraryProgrammersManual.md#_silgen_name).

## `@_specialize(...)`

Forces generation of a specialized implementation for a generic declaration.

See [Generics.rst](/docs/Generics.rst) for more details.

## `@_specializeExtension`

Allows extending `@usableFromInline` internal types from foreign modules.
Consider the following example involving two modules:

```swift
// Module A
@usableFromInline
internal struct S<T> { /* ... */ }

// Module B
import A

@_specializeExtension
extension S { // OK
  // add methods here
}

extension S /* or A.S */ { // error: cannot find 'S' in scope
}
```

This ability can be used to add specializations of existing methods
in downstream libraries when used in conjunction with `@_specialize`.

```swift
// Module A
@usableFromInline
internal struct S<T> {
  @inlinable
  internal func doIt() { /* body */ }
}

// Module B
import A

@_specializeExtension
extension S { // ok
  @_specialize(exported: true, target: doIt(), where T == Int)
  public func specializedDoIt() {}
}

// Module C
import A
import B

func f(_ s: S<Int>) {
  s.doIt() // will call specialized version of doIt() where T == Int from B
}
```

## `@_spi(spiName)`

Marks a declaration as SPI (System Programming Interface), instead of API.
Modules exposing SPI and using library evolution generate an additional
`.private.swiftinterface` file (with `-emit-private-module-interface-path`)
in addition to the usual `.swiftinterface` file. This private interface exposes
both API and SPI.

Clients can access SPI by marking the import as `@_spi(spiName) import Module`.
This design makes it easy to find out which clients are using certain SPIs by
doing a textual search.

## `@_staticInitializeObjCMetadata`

Indicates that a static initializer should be emitted to register the
Objective-C metadata when the image is loaded, rather than on first use of the
Objective-C metadata.

This attribute is inferred for `NSCoding` classes that won't
have static Objective-C metadata or have an `@NSKeyedArchiveLegacy` attribute.

## `@_transparent`

Marks a function to be "macro-like", i.e., it is guaranteed to be inlined
in debug builds.

See [TransparentAttr.md](/docs/TransparentAttr.md) for more details.

## `@_typeEraser(Proto)`

Marks a concrete nominal type as one that implements type erasure for a
protocol `Proto`.

A type eraser has the following restrictions:

1. It must be a concrete nominal type.
2. It must not have more restrictive access than `Proto`.
3. It must conform to `Proto`.
4. It must have an initializer of the form `init<T: Proto>(erasing: T)`.
  - Other generic requirements are permitted as long as the `init` can always
    be called with a value of any type conforming to `Proto`.
  - The `init` cannot have more restrictive access than `Proto`.

This feature was designed to be used for compiler-driven type erasure for
dynamic replacement of functions with an opaque return type.

## `@_weakLinked`

Allows a declaration to be weakly-referenced, i.e., any references emitted by
client modules to the declaration's symbol will have weak linkage. This means
that client code will compile without the guarantee that the symbol will be
available at runtime. This requires a dynamic safety check (such as using
`dlsym (3)`); otherwise, accessing the symbol when it is unavailable leads
to a runtime crash.

This is an unsafe alternative to using `@available`, which is statically checked.
If the availability of a library symbol is newer than the deployment target of
the client, the symbol will be weakly linked, but checking for `@available` and
`#(un)available` ensures that a symbol is not accessed when it is unavailable.

## `@_unsafeMainActor`, `@_unsafeSendable`

Marks a parameter's (function) type as `@MainActor` (`@Sendable`) in Swift 6 and
within Swift 5 code that has adopted concurrency, but non-`@MainActor`
(non-`@Sendable`) everywhere else.

See the forum post on [Concurrency in Swift 5 and 6](https://forums.swift.org/t/concurrency-in-swift-5-and-6/49337)
for more details.
