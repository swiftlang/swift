/// The compile-time representation of a metadata request.  There are
/// essentially three patterns of use here:
///
/// - In the first pattern, the request is static and blocking, meaning
///   that the operation which produces the metadata should not return
///   until it's able to return a metadata that's in the requested state.
///   Most places in IRGen will use blocking requests, often for complete
///   metadata, because operations like allocating a value or passing a
///   metadata off as a generic parameter (or metatype value) (1) cannot be
///   performed without the metadata in the right state but also (2) cannot
///   be suspended to await the production of the metadata.
///
/// - In the second pattern, the request is static and non-blocking, and
///   there is a dependency collector associated with the request.  This is
///   used in the special case of a type metadata's initialization phase.
///   This phase can fail, but when it does so, it must report a type
///   metadata (and its requested state) that it is blocked on.  The runtime
///   will then delay the initialization of that type metadata until its
///   dependency is resolved.
///
/// - In the final pattern, the request is a dynamic value.  This is used
///   primarily in type metadata access functions like the global
///   access functions for generic types or the associated type access
///   functions on protocol witness tables.  These functions must report
///   the actual best-known dynamic state of the metadata that they return.
///   Access functions that memoize their result must therefore suppress the
///   memoization when the metadata is not yet complete.

/// A response to a metadata request (but see below for other ways in which
/// this type is used).  In addition to a type metadata reference, the response
/// includes static and dynamic information about the state of the metadata.
///
/// A type metadata technically goes through a progression of phases.  Many
/// metadata just start in the final "complete" phase, but it's important
/// to understand this phase progression in order to understand what happens
/// in the more complex cases.
///
/// - The first phase of the metadata is called "allocation", and it ensures
///   that there is exactly one metadata for a particular type.  We don't
///   need to say anything else about metadata allocation here, however,
///   because a metadata object in this phase is never exposed outside of
///   the runtime (and narrow confines of the metadata allocation function).
///   This is also why MetadataState does not have an enumerator for this state.
///
/// - Once a metadata has been allocated, it is considered to be "abstract".
///   An abstract metadata only has enough structure to represent its basic
///   identity as a type: its type kind and the basic components of its
///   identity.  For example, A<T> will always store the type descriptor
///   for A and the type metadata for T, but it does not necessarily have
///   anything else, like a value witness table or a superclass reference.
///
/// - A metadata is said to be "layout-complete" if it has a meaningful
///   "external layout", the principal component of which is a meaningful
///   value witness table.  Such a metadata allows other types which store
///   values of the metadata's type to be laid out.  However, there may still
///   be restrictions on the use of the metadata which make it unready
///   for general use.
///
///   Some types may have no observable abstract phase.  For example, all
///   class types are layout-complete immediately upon allocation, as are
///   value types with a fixed layout for all instantiations.
///
/// - A metadata is said to be "complete" if it supports all possible
///   operations on the type.  This includes any necessary "internal layout",
///   such as the field layout of a class type, as well as any sundry
///   initialization tasks like the registration of a class type with the
///   Objective-C runtime.  This is also the first phase of a class metadata
///   that promises that it has a superclass pointer.  Furthermore, some
///   types make stronger transitive guarantees about the state of their
///   stored component types when they are complete than when they are in
///   earlier stages.
///
/// --
///
/// A MetadataResponse stores two pieces of information about its state.
///
/// The first piece of information is a static lower bound (i.e. a
/// conservative estimate) on the state.  This will always be at least
/// MetadataState::Abstract, since no metadata in general circulation can
/// still be undergoing allocation.  It may be higher than that because of
/// static information about the request or the type being requested.
///
/// The second piece of information is the dynamic state of the metadata.
/// When metadata is fetched from the runtime, the runtime will report
/// its current known state.  We cache this state and generally assume that
/// nothing in the function will cause it to change.  This is okay because:
///
/// - with blocking requests, we will generally ignore the dynamic state
///   and instead just block waiting for the runtime to report that the
///   metadata has reached the requested state, whereas
///
/// - with non-blocking and dynamic requests, ephemeral staleness is
///   recoverable --- in fact, it has to be, because of course as soon as
///   the runtime has finished reporting a state, that state has become
///   potentially stale due to concurrent initialization).
///
/// Other than fetching metadata from the runtime, most of the ways that
/// we produce metadata guarantee that the metadata is complete.  For example,
/// fixed-layout non-generic value types just provide complete metadata at
/// known global symbols.  There are a few rare exceptions where we do need
/// pull metadata from somewhere but don't actually know its dynamic state.
/// For example, it would be unwise to try to store the dynamic state of
/// a generic type argument in the generic type's metadata; unlike the
/// arguments above, such an approach would be highly non-ephemeral and
/// create substantial staleness problems.  For these situations, the
/// runtime provides a function, swift_checkMetadataState, to request (or
/// block on) the current state of a type metadata.
///
/// --
/// 
/// While this class is principally used to report the response to a type
/// metadata request, it does have some secondary uses.
///
/// The first secondary use is that it is sometimes used to store other
/// forms of local type data so that common code structures can work with
/// both them and type metadata.  For example, concrete local type data are
/// stored in a MetadataResponse even though they aren't always type metadata.
/// When this is happening, the metadata state will always be statically
/// complete.
///
/// The second secondary use is that it's sometimes used to just store the
/// known state of a fetched metadata in a more persistent way.  This is
/// because many of the places that store metadata have at least some case
/// where it's important to known either the static bound on the metadata
/// state or, more importantly, to report the actual dynamic state that was
/// reported when the metadata was first acquired.  Propagating the metadata
/// as a MetadataResponse makes this straightforward.
