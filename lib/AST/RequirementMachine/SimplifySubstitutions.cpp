//
// Implements a pass for simplifying substitutions in concrete type symbols.
// Substitutions can be simplified in one of two ways; either a substitution
// term can be replaced by a more canonical term, or it can be replaced by a
// concrete type.
//
// For example, given pair of rewrite rules:
//
//    T.[concrete: G<Y>] => T
//    Y => X
//
// We can apply (Y => X) to the term appearing in the concrete type symbol
// [concrete: G<Y>] to obtain the rule:
//
//    T.[concrete: G<X>] => T
//
// Similarly, if we have a pair of rewrite rules:
//
//    T.[concrete: G<Y>] => T
//    Y.[concrete: Int] => Y
//
// We can obtain the new rule:
//
//    T.[concrete: G<Int>] => T
//
// Substitution simplification occurs during the Knuth-Bendix completion
// procedure, and after property map construction.
//
// In the first case, no property map is available yet, so substitution terms
// are simplified to other terms, but concrete type replacement is not
// performed. In the second case, the property map is consulted to perform
// concrete type replacement where appropriate.
//
// Either the new rule or the old rule can become redundant; they are related
// by rewrite loops. Additionally, rewrite loops are introduced for each
// transformation applied to the substitutions to relate them to the concrete
// type rules via "projections".
//
// These rewrite loops are in a sense dual to the property map's concrete type
// unification, and share a lot of the code; whereas the property map will
// relate two rules (T.[concrete: G<X>] => T) with (T.[concrete: G<Y>] => T)
// and add the induced rule (Y => X), substitution simplification will use
// (Y => X) to transform (T.[concrete: G<Y>] => T) into
// (T.[concrete: G<X>] => T).
//
// This logic (and concrete type unification) heavily relies on the "type
// difference" abstraction implemented in TypeDifference.cpp. Technical details
// about the various rewrite loops introduced here can be found in comments at
// the top of various functions below.

///
/// The rewrite path should allow us to eliminate the induced rule
/// (f(Xn) => Xn), so the induced rule will appear without context, and
/// the concrete type rules (T.[LHS] => T) and (T.[RHS] => T) will appear
/// in context.
///
/// There are two cases:
///
/// a) The substitution Xn remains a type parameter in [RHS], but becomes
///    a canonical term Xn', so f(Xn) = Xn'.
///
///    In the first case, the induced rule (Xn => Xn'), described by a
///    rewrite path as follows:
///
///    Xn
///    Xn' T.[RHS] // RightConcreteProjection(n) pushes T.[RHS]
///    Xn' T       // Application of (T.[RHS] => T) in context
///    Xn' T.[LHS] // Application of (T => T.[LHS]) in context
///    Xn'         // LeftConcreteProjection(n) pops T.[LHS]
///
///    Now when this path is composed with a rewrite step for the inverted
///    induced rule (Xn' => Xn), we get a rewrite loop at Xn in which the
///    new rule appears in empty context.
///
/// b) The substitution Xn becomes a concrete type [D] in [C'], so
///    f(Xn) = Xn.[D].
///
///    In the second case, the induced rule is (Xn.[D] => Xn), described
///    by a rewrite path (going in the other direction) as follows:
///
///    Xn
///    Xn.[D] T.[RHS] // RightConcreteProjection(n) pushes T.[RHS]
///    Xn.[D] T       // Application of (T.[RHS] => T) in context
///    Xn.[D] T.[LHS] // Application of (T => T.[LHS]) in context
///    Xn.[D]         // LeftConcreteProjection(n) pops T.[LHS]
///
///    Now when this path is composed with a rewrite step for the induced
///    rule (Xn.[D] => Xn), we get a rewrite loop at Xn in which the
///    new rule appears in empty context.
///
/// There is a minor complication; the concrete type rules T.[LHS] and
/// T.[RHS] might actually be T.[LHS] and V.[RHS] where V is a suffix of
/// T, so T = U.V for some |U| > 0, (or vice versa). In this case we need
/// an additional step in the middle to prefix the concrete substitutions
/// of [LHS] (or [LHS]) with U.
