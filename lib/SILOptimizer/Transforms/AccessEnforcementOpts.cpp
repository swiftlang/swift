/// Pass order dependencies:
///
/// - Will benefit from running after AccessEnforcementSelection.
///
/// - Should run immediately before the AccessEnforcementWMO to share
///   AccessedStorageAnalysis results.
///
/// This pass optimizes access enforcement as follows:
///
/// **Access marker folding**
///
/// Find begin/end access scopes that are uninterrupted by a potential
/// conflicting access. Flag those as [nontracking] access.
///
/// Folding must prove that no dynamic conflicts occur inside of an access
/// scope. That is, a scope has no "nested inner conflicts". The access itself
/// may still conflict with an outer scope. If successful, folding simply sets
/// the [no_nested_conflict] attribute on the begin_[unpaired_]access
/// instruction and removes all corresponding end_[unpaired_]access
/// instructions.
///
/// This analysis is conceptually similar to DiagnoseStaticExclusivity. The
/// difference is that it conservatively considers any dynamic access that may
/// alias, as opposed to only the obviously aliasing accesses (it is the
/// complement of the static diagnostic pass in that respect). This makes a
/// considerable difference in the implementation. For example,
/// DiagnoseStaticExclusivity must be able to fully analyze all @inout_aliasable
/// parameters because they aren't dynamically enforced. This optimization
/// completely ignores @inout_aliasable paramters because it only cares about
/// dynamic enforcement. This optimization also does not attempt to
/// differentiate accesses on disjoint subaccess paths, because it should not
/// weaken enforcement in any way--a program that traps at -Onone should also
/// trap at -O.
///
/// Access folding is a forward data flow analysis that tracks open accesses. If
/// any path to an access' end of scope has a potentially conflicting access,
/// then that access is marked as a nested conflict.
///
/// **Local access marker removal**
///
/// When none of the local accesses on local storage (box/stack) have nested
/// conflicts, then all the local accesses may be disabled by setting their
/// enforcement to `static`. This is somwhat rare because static diagnostics
/// already promote the obvious cases to static checks. However, there are two
/// reasons that dynamic local markers may be disabled: (1) inlining may cause
/// closure access to become local access (2) local storage may truly escape,
/// but none of the the local access scopes cross a call site.
///
/// TODO: Perform another run of AccessEnforcementSelection immediately before
/// this pass. Currently, that pass only works well when run before
/// AllocBox2Stack. Ideally all such closure analysis passes are combined into a
/// shared analysis with a set of associated optimizations that can be rerun at
/// any point in the pipeline. Until then, we could settle for a partially
/// working AccessEnforcementSelection, or expand it somewhat to handle
/// alloc_stack.
///
/// **Access marker merger**
///
/// When a pair of non-overlapping accesses, where the first access dominates
/// the second and there are no conflicts on the same storage in the paths
/// between them, and they are part of the same sub-region
/// be it the same block or the sampe loop, merge those accesses to create
/// a new, larger, scope with a single begin_access for the accesses.
