/// This pass eliminates redundant loads.
///
/// A load can be eliminated if its value has already been held somewhere,
/// i.e. generated by a previous load, LSLocation stored by a known value.
///
/// In this case, one can replace the load instruction with the previous
/// results.
///
/// Redundant Load Elimination (RLE) eliminates such loads by:
///
/// 1. Introducing a notion of a LSLocation that is used to model object
/// fields. (See below for more details).
///
/// 2. Introducing a notion of a LSValue that is used to model the value
/// that currently resides in the associated LSLocation on the particular
/// program path. (See below for more details).
///
/// 3. Performing a RPO walk over the control flow graph, tracking any
/// LSLocations that are read from or stored into in each basic block. The
/// read or stored value, kept in a map between LSLocation and LSValue,
/// becomes the available value for the LSLocation.
///
/// 4. An optimistic iterative intersection-based dataflow is performed on the
/// gensets until convergence.
///
/// At the core of RLE, there is the LSLocation class. A LSLocation is an
/// abstraction of an object field in program. It consists of a base and a
/// projection path to the field accessed.
///
/// In SIL, one can access an aggregate as a whole, i.e. store to a struct with
/// 2 Int fields. A store like this will generate 2 *indivisible* LSLocations,
/// 1 for each field and in addition to keeping a list of LSLocation, RLE also
/// keeps their available LSValues. We call it *indivisible* because it
/// cannot be broken down to more LSLocations.
///
/// LSValue consists of a base - a SILValue from the load or store inst,
/// as well as a projection path to which the field it represents. So, a
/// store to an 2-field struct as mentioned above will generate 2 LSLocations
/// and 2 LSValues.
///
/// Every basic block keeps a map between LSLocation and LSValue. By
/// keeping the LSLocation and LSValue in their indivisible form, one
/// can easily find which part of the load is redundant and how to compute its
/// forwarding value.
///
/// Given the case which the 2 fields of the struct both have available values,
/// RLE can find their LSValues (maybe by struct_extract from a larger
/// value) and then aggregate them.
///
/// However, this may introduce a lot of extraction and aggregation which may
/// not be necessary. i.e. a store the struct followed by a load from the
/// struct. To solve this problem, when RLE detects that a load instruction
/// can be replaced by forwarded value, it will try to find minimum # of
/// extractions necessary to form the forwarded value. It will group the
/// available value's by the LSValue base, i.e. the LSValues come from the
/// same instruction, and then use extraction to obtain the needed components
/// of the base.
