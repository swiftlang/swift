/// The function is passed a state value, which it can freely mutate. The
/// initial value of the state will be the same as the value left in the
/// state for an unspecified predecessor. For the entry block of the

///
/// Essentially, runInDominanceOrder finds an arbitrary simple path to
/// the block and runs the callback function for each block in that path
/// in order. As long as the callback:
/// - only looks at instructions in the current block and the blocks
///   it dominates,
/// - has no dependencies outside of the state (which must have "value
///   semantics"), and
/// - can handle the arbitrariness of the choice of path,
/// then the callback can act as if only the work done along the current
/// path has happened and ignore the impact of arbitrary visitation order.

///
/// The state consists of (1) an active stack of allocations which

/// status for each allocation.
///
/// It has five invariants:
///
/// 1. Allocations on the stack dominate all allocations above them.
/// 2. Every allocation on the stack dominates the current point
///    being considered.
/// 3. The top of the stack never has pending status.

/// 5. If an allocation has pending status, there is an allocation
///    above it on the stack which has allocated status.
///
/// The twist about the search order and state relates to the
/// non-coherence of SIL's joint post-dominance requirement for stack
/// allocations. Specifically, SIL permits the current state of the
/// stack to vary on different edges into a dead-end region; this just
/// means it is not permitted to pop any of those deallocations from
/// the stack. (More allocations can be pushed and popped, but the
/// existing ones become untouchable.) StackNesting therefore permits
/// its input to be non-coherent: whether an allocation has been
/// deallocated is allowed to vary across the entries to a dead-end
/// region.
///
/// To handle this, the search delays considering edges into a dead-end
/// region until it has seen the last such edge. Furthermore, the
/// initial state of the destination block is set to a conservative
/// merger of the final states of all of the predecessors: if two
/// states differ in any way, the contents of the stack are pared
/// back to the common prefix, and all allocations are placed in the
/// undeallocatable state.
