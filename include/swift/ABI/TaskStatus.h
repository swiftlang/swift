/// should only be modified in ways that respect the possibility of asynchronous
/// access by a different thread.  In particular, the chain of status records
/// must not be disturbed. When the task leaves the scope that requires the
/// status record, the record can be unregistered from the task with
/// `removeStatusRecord`, at which point the memory can be returned to the
/// system.
