/// resources like CPU time or memory the process used in the system. How ever,
/// this could differ from platform to platform and is therefore optional.

/// One process could handle multiple tasks in some modes of the Swift compiler
/// (multifile, WMO). To not break existing tools, the driver does use unique
/// identifiers for the tasks that are not the process identifier. To still be
/// able to reason about tasks that ran in the same process the
/// TaskProcessInformation struct contains information about the actual process
/// of the operating system. The OSPid is the actual process identifier and is
/// therefore not guaranteed to be unique over all tasks. The ProcessUsage
/// contains optional usage information about the operating system process. It
/// could be used by tools that take those information as input for analyzing
/// the Swift compiler on a process-level. It will be `None` if the execution
/// has been skipped or one of the following symbols are not available on the
