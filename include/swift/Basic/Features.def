//
// This file defines macros used for macro-metaprogramming with language
// features.
//
//
// LANGUAGE_FEATURE(FeatureName, SENumber, Description)
//
//   The LANGUAGE_FEATURE macro describes each named feature that is
//   introduced in Swift. It allows Swift code to check for a particular
//   feature with "#if $FeatureName" in source code.
//
//     FeatureName: The name given to this feature to be used in source code,
//       e.g., AsyncAwait.
//     SENumber: The number assigned to this feature in the Swift Evolution
//       process, or 0 if there isn't one.
//     Description: A string literal describing the feature.
//
// Suppressible language features can be suppressed when printing
// an interface without having to suppress the entire declaration they're
// contained within.  The declaration will be emitted multiple times,
// each with a subset of the suppressible features.  To avoid combinatoric
// re-emission, we assume a linear history: later features in this file
// imply the existence of earlier features.  (This only needs to apply to
// suppressible features.)
//
// Sometimes, certain declarations will conflict with existing declarations
// when printed with a suppressible feature disabled. The attribute
// @_disallowFeatureSuppression can be used to suppress feature suppression on
// a particular declaration.
//
// If suppressing a feature in general is problematic, but it's okay to
// suppress it for specific declarations, the feature can be made
// conditionally suppressible.  Declarations opt in to suppression with
// the @_allowFeatureSuppression attribute.
//
// BASELINE_LANGUAGE_FEATURE is the same as LANGUAGE_FEATURE, but is used
// for features that can be assumed to be available in any Swift compiler that
// will be used to process the textual interface files produced by this
// Swift compiler.
//
// OPTIONAL_LANGUAGE_FEATURE is the same as LANGUAGE_FEATURE, but describes
// accepted features that can be enabled independently of language version and
// are not scheduled to be enabled in some specific language version. Examples
// of optional language features include strict memory safety checking (SE-0458)
// and Embedded Swift.

// An upcoming feature that supports migration mode.

// If the feature is source-breaking and provides for a
// mechanical code migration, it should implement migration mode.
//
// Migration mode is a feature-oriented code migration mechanism: a mode
// of operation that should produce compiler warnings with attached
// fix-its that can be applied to preserve the behavior of the code once
// the upcoming feature is enacted.
// These warnings must belong to a diagnostic group named after the
// feature. Migration mode itself *and* the fix-its it produces must be
// source and binary compatible with how the code is compiled when the
// feature is disabled.
