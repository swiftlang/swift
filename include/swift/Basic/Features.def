// This file defines macros used for macro-metaprogramming with language
// features.
//
//
// LANGUAGE_FEATURE(FeatureName, SENumber, Description, Option)
//
//   The LANGUAGE_FEATURE macro describes each named feature that is
//   introduced in Swift. It allows Swift code to check for a particular
//   feature with "#if $FeatureName" in source code.
//
//     FeatureName: The name given to this feature to be used in source code,
//       e.g., AsyncAwait.
//     SENumber: The number assigned to this feature in the Swift Evolution
//       process, or 0 if there isn't one.
//     Description: A string literal describing the feature.
//     Option: either a reference to a language option in the form
//       "langOpts.<option name>" or "true" to indicate that it's always
//       enabled.
