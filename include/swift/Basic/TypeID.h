/// The return type of requests that execute side effects.
///
/// In general, it is not appropriate to use the request evaluator framework to
/// execute a request for the sake of its side effects. However, there are
/// operations we would currently like to be requests because it makes modelling
/// some aspect of their implementation particularly nice. For example, an
/// operation that emits diagnostics to run some checking code in a primary
/// file may be desirable to requestify because it should be run only once per
/// declaration, but it has no coherent return value. Another category of
/// side-effecting requests are those that adapt existing parts of the compiler that
/// do not yet behave in a "functional" manner to have a functional interface. Consider
/// the request to run the SIL Optimizer. In theory, it should be a request that takes in
/// a SILModule and returns a SILModule. In practice, it is a request that executes
/// effects against a SILModule.
///
/// To make these requests stand out - partially in the hope we can return and
/// refactor them to behave in a more well-structured manner, partially because
/// they cannot return \c void or we will get template substitution failures - we
/// annotate them as computing an \c evaluator::SideEffect.
