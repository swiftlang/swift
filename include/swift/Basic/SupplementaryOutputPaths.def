/// The path to which we should emit a header file that exposes the Swift
/// declarations to C, Objective-C and C++ clients for the module.
///
/// Currently only makes sense when the compiler has whole module knowledge.
/// The modes for which it makes sense incuide both WMO and the "merge
/// modules" job that happens after the normal compilation jobs. That's where
/// the header is emitted in single-file mode, since it needs whole-module
/// information.
///
/// \sa swift::printAsClangHeader
OUTPUT(ClangHeaderOutputPath, TY_ClangHeader)

/// The path to which we should emit a serialized module.
/// It is valid whenever there are any inputs.
///
/// This binary format is used to describe the interface of a module when
/// imported by client source code. The swiftmodule format is described in
/// docs/Serialization.md.
///
/// \sa swift::serialize
OUTPUT(ModuleOutputPath, TY_SwiftModuleFile)

/// The path to which we should emit a module source information file.
/// It is valid whenever there are any inputs.
///
/// This binary format stores source locations and other information about the
/// declarations in a module.
///
/// \sa swift::serialize
OUTPUT(ModuleSourceInfoOutputPath, TY_SwiftSourceInfoFile)

/// The path to which we should emit a module documentation file.
/// It is valid whenever there are any inputs.
///
/// This binary format stores doc comments and other information about the
/// declarations in a module.
///
/// \sa swift::serialize
OUTPUT(ModuleDocOutputPath, TY_SwiftModuleDocFile)

/// The path to which we should output a Make-style dependencies file.
/// It is valid whenever there are any inputs.
///
/// Swift's compilation model means that Make-style dependencies aren't
/// well-suited to model fine-grained dependencies. See docs/Driver.md for
/// more information.
///
/// \sa ReferenceDependenciesFilePath
OUTPUT(DependenciesFilePath, TY_Dependencies)

/// The path to which we should output a Swift "reference dependencies" file.
/// It is valid whenever there are any inputs.
///
/// "Reference dependencies" track dependencies on a more fine-grained level
/// than just "this file depends on that file". With Swift's "implicit
/// visibility" within a module, that becomes very important for any sort of
/// incremental build. These files are consumed by the Swift driver to decide
/// whether a source file needs to be recompiled during a build. See
/// docs/DependencyAnalysis.md for more information.
///
/// \sa swift::emitReferenceDependencies
/// \sa DependencyGraph
OUTPUT(ReferenceDependenciesFilePath, TY_SwiftDeps)

/// Path to a file which should contain serialized diagnostics for this
/// frontend invocation.
///
/// This uses the same serialized diagnostics format as Clang, for tools that
/// want machine-parseable diagnostics. There's a bit more information on
/// how clients might use this in docs/Driver.md.
///
/// \sa swift::serialized_diagnostics::createConsumer
OUTPUT(SerializedDiagnosticsPath, TY_SerializedDiagnostics)

/// The path to which we should output fix-its as source edits.
///
/// This is a JSON-based format that is used by the migrator, but is not
/// really vetted for anything else.
///
/// \sa swift::writeEditsInJson
OUTPUT(FixItsOutputPath, TY_SwiftFixIt)

/// The path to which we should output a loaded module trace file.
/// It is valid whenever there are any inputs.
///
/// The file is appended to, and consists of line-delimited JSON objects,
/// where each line is of the form `{ "name": NAME, "target": TARGET,
/// "swiftmodules": [PATH, PATH, ...] }`, representing the (real-path) PATHs
/// to each .swiftmodule that was loaded while building module NAME for target
/// TARGET. This format is subject to arbitrary change, however.
OUTPUT(LoadedModuleTracePath, TY_ModuleTrace)
OUTPUT(FineModuleTracePath,   TY_FineModuleTrace)

/// The path to which we should output a TBD file.
///
/// "TBD" stands for "text-based dylib". It's a YAML-based format that
/// describes the public ABI of a library, which clients can link against
/// without having an actual dynamic library binary.
///
/// Only makes sense when the compiler has whole-module knowledge.
///
/// \sa swift::writeTBDFile
OUTPUT(TBDPath, TY_TBD)

/// The path to which we should emit a module interface, which can
/// be used by a client source file to import this module.
///
/// This format is similar to the binary format used for #ModuleOutputPath,
/// but is intended to be stable across compiler versions.
///
/// Currently only makes sense when the compiler has whole-module knowledge.
///
/// \sa swift::emitSwiftInterface
OUTPUT(ModuleInterfaceOutputPath, TY_SwiftModuleInterfaceFile)

/// The path to which we should emit a private module interface.
///
/// The private module interface contains all SPI decls and attributes.
///
/// \sa ModuleInterfaceOutputPath
