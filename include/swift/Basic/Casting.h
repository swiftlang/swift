/// Cast between two function types. Use in place of std::bit_cast, which
/// doesn't work on ARM64e with address-discriminated signed function types.
///
/// Address-discriminated ptrauth attributes can only be applied to values with
/// a defined storage location, such as struct fields, since their value is
/// inherently tied to their address. They can't be applied to function
/// paremeters. When passing such a value to a templated function, the ptrauth
/// attribute disappears from the inferred type.
///
/// bit_cast takes the source by reference, which means that the ptrauth
/// attribute remains on the inferred type, and the value is not trivially
/// copyable.
///
/// function_cast instead takes the source by value, avoiding that issue and
/// ensuring that passed-in function pointers are always trivially copyable.
