/// Binary operations have type (T,T) -> T.
///
/// We define two different sorts of operations varying when T is static,
/// specifically:
///
/// 1. Overloaded statically typed operations. E.x:
///
///       builtin "add_Vec4xInt32"(Vec4xInt32, Vec4xInt32) : Vec4xInt32.
///
/// 2. Polymorphic typed operations that are valid only in raw SIL. By the time
///    diagnostic constant propagation runs, these must have as its operand a
///    fully specialized type. If the builtin has a type that is not one of its
///    overloaded types, diagnostic constant propagation will emit a diagnostic
///    saying the builtin's type has not been fully resolved. Otherwise,
///    diagnostic constant propagation will transform the builtin to the
///    relevant static overloaded builtin form. E.x.:
///
///       builtin "add"(Self, Self) : Self // *error*
///
///         OR
///
///       builtin "generic_add"(Vec4xInt32, Vec4xInt32) : Vec4xInt32
///         ->
///       builtin "add_Vec4xInt32"(Vec4xInt32, Vec4xInt32) : Vec4xInt32
///
/// NOTE: If a polymorphic typed operation is not static by the time guaranteed
/// constant propagation runs, we emit a diagnostic to inform the user (who is
/// assumed to be an expert user) to tell them the value was unspecialized. The
/// typical way this specialization occurs today is via transparent inlining
/// since the transparent inliner devirtualizes and specializes as it goes. Of
/// course this means mandatory inlining must /always/ occur before diagnostic
/// constant propagation.
///
/// NOTE: Often times the builtin infrastructure wants to treat all
/// binary operation builtins generic or not the same way. To ensure
/// we support all use cases in the compiler, we do not declare the
/// operations as part of this builtin since often times this macro is
/// used to generic code. Instead, we stamp this out using the
/// overloaded_static, polymorphic, and all suffixed operations.
