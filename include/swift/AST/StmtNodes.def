/// STMT(Id, Parent)
///   If the statement node is not abstract, its enumerator value is
///   StmtKind::Id.  The node's class name is Id##Stmt, and the name of
///   its base class (in the Stmt hierarchy) is Parent.

/// An abstract statement node is an abstract base class in the hierarchy;
/// it is never a most-derived type, and it does not have an enumerator in
/// StmtKind.
///
/// Most metaprograms do not care about abstract statements, so the default
/// is to ignore them.
