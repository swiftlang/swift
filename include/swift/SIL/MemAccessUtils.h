/// These utilities model the storage locations of memory access. See
/// SILMemoryAccess.md for high-level design.
///
/// Terminology: In the examples below, 'address' is the address of the memory
/// operation, 'access' is the address of the formal access scope, 'base' is the
/// address of the formally accessed memory, and 'root' is the reference root of
/// the object that the formally accessed memory is a member of.
///
///  struct S {
///    var field: Int64
///   }
///   class C {
///     var prop: S
///   }
///
///   %root    = alloc_ref $C
///   %base    = ref_element_addr %root : $C, #C.prop
///   %access  = begin_access [read] [static] %base : $*S
///   %address = struct_element_addr %access : $*S, #.field
///   %value   = load [trivial] %address : $*Int64
///   end_access %access : $*S
/// 
/// OR
/// 
///   %root    = alloc_box $S
///   %base    = project_box %root : ${ var S }
///   %access  = begin_access [read] [static] %base : $*S
///   %address = struct_element_addr %access : $*S, #.field
///   %value   = load [trivial] %address : $*Int64
///   end_access %access : $*S
///
/// All memory operations that are part of a formal access, as defined by
/// exclusivity rules, are marked by begin_access and end_access instructions.
///
///     Currently, access markers are stripped early in the pipeline. An active
///     goal is to require access markers in OSSA form, and to enable access
///     marker verification.
///
/// To verify access markers, SIL checks that all memory operations either have
/// an address that originates in begin_access, or originates from a pattern
/// that is recognized as a non-formal-access. This implies that every SIL
/// memory operation has a recognizable address source. Given the address of a
/// memory operation, there are three levels of APIs that inspect the origin of
/// that address:
///
/// 1. getTypedAccessAddress(): Find the originating address as close as
/// possible to the address of the formal access *without* looking past any
/// storage casts. This is useful when the type of the returned access address
/// must be consistent with the memory operation's type (the same type or a
/// parent type). For a formal access, this typically returns the begin_access,
/// but it is not guaranteed to because some accesses contain storage casts
/// (TODO: make storage casts within access scopes illegal). For non-formal
/// access, it returns a best-effort address corresponding to the base of an
/// access.
///
/// 2. getAccessScope(): If the memory operation is part of a formal access,
/// then this is guaranteed to return the begin_access marker. Otherwise, it
/// returns the best-effort address or pointer corresponding to the base of an
/// access. Useful to find the scope of a formal access.
///
/// 3. getAccessBase(): Find the ultimate base of any address corresponding to
/// the accessed object, regardless of whether the address is nested within
/// access scopes, and regardless of any storage casts. This returns either an
/// address or pointer type, but never a reference or box type.
/// Each object's property or its tail storage is separately accessed.
///
/// In addition to the free-standing functions, the AccessBase and
/// AccessStorage classes encapsulate the identity of an access. They can be
/// used to:
/// - directly compare and hash access identities
/// - exhaustively switch over the kinds of accesses
/// - cache access lookups for repeated queries
///
/// AccessBase::compute() follows the same logic as getAccessBase(), but if the
/// base is not recognized as a valid access, it returns invalid
/// AccessBase. AccessStorage::compute() extends this API by using
/// findReferenceRoot() to more precisely identify the storage object.
///
/// AccessBase::compute() and AccessStorage::compute() can be called on the
/// address of any memory operation, the address of a begin_access, or any other
/// address value. If the address is the operand of any enforced begin_access or
/// any memory operation that corresponds to formal access, then compute()
/// must return a valid AccessBase or AccessStorage value. If the memory
/// operation is *not* part of a formal access, then it still identifies the
/// accessed storage as a best effort, but the result may be invalid storage.
///
///    An active goal is to require compute() to always return a
///    valid AccessStorage value even for operations that aren't part of a
///    formal access.
///
/// The AccessEnforcementWMO pass is an example of an optimistic optimization
/// that relies on this requirement for correctness. If
/// AccessStorage::compute() simply bailed out on an unrecognized memory
/// address by returning an invalid AccessStorage, then the optimization could
/// make incorrect assumptions about the absence of access to globals or class
/// properties.
///
/// computeInScope() returns an AccessBase or AccessStorage value for the
/// immediately enclosing access scope. Within a formal access, it always
/// returns a Nested storage kind, which provides the begin_access marker.
///
/// identifyFormalAccess() works like AccessStorage::computeInScope(), but it
/// should only be passed finds an address that is the operand of a begin_access
/// marker, rather than any arbitrary address. This must return a valid
/// AccessStorage value unless the access has "Unsafe" enforcement. The given
/// begin_access marker may be nested within another, outer access scope. For
/// the purpose of exclusivity, nested accesses are considered distinct formal
/// accesses so they return distinct AccessStorage values even though they may
/// access the same memory. This way, nested accesses do not appear to conflict.
///
/// AccessPath identifies both the accessed storage and the path to a specific
/// storage location within that storage object. See SILMemoryAccess.md and the
/// class comments below for details. AccessPath::compute() and
/// AccessPath::computeInScope() mirror the AccessStorage API.
/// AccessPath::contains() and AccessPath::mayOverlap() provide efficient
/// comparison of access paths.
///
/// AccessPath::collectUses() gathers all reachable uses of the accessed
/// storage, allowing the selection of Exact, Inner, or Overlapping uses.
/// visitAccessStorageUses() and visitAccessPathUses() generalize
/// handling of all reachable uses for a given storage location.
