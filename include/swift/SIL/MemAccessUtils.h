///
/// These utilities model the storage locations of memory access. See
/// ProgrammersGuide.md for high-level design.
///
/// All memory operations that are part of a formal access, as defined by
/// exclusivity rules, are marked by begin_access and end_access instructions.
///
///     Currently, access markers are stripped early in the pipeline. An active
///     goal is to require access markers in OSSA form, and to enable access
///     marker verification.
///
/// To verify access markers, SIL checks that all memory operations either have
/// an address that originates in begin_access, or originates from a pattern
/// that is recognized as a non-formal-access. This implies that every SIL
/// memory operation has a recognizable address source. Given the address of a
/// memory operation, there are three levels of APIs that inspect the origin of
/// that address:
///
/// 1. getTypedAccessAddress(): Find the originating address as close as
/// possible to the address of the formal access *without* looking past any
/// storage casts. This is useful when the type of the returned access address
/// must be consistent with the memory operation's type (the same type or a
/// parent type). For a formal access, this typically returns the begin_access,
/// but it is not guaranteed to because some accesses contain storage casts. For
/// non-formal access, it returns a best-effort address corresponding to the
/// base of an access.
///
/// 2. getAccessScope(): If the memory operation is part of a formal access,
/// then this is guaranteed to return the begin_access marker. Otherwise, it
/// returns the best-effort address or pointer corresponding to the base of an
/// access. Useful to find the scope of a formal access.
///
/// 3. getAccessBase(): Find the ultimate base of any address corresponding to
/// the accessed object, regardless of whether the address is nested within
/// access scopes, and regardless of any storage casts. This returns either an
/// address type, pointer type, or box type, but never a reference type.
/// Each object's property or its tail storage is separately accessed.
///
/// For better identification an access base, use
/// AccessedStorage::compute(). It returns an AccessedStorage value
/// that identifies the storage of a memory access. It provides APIs
/// for inspecting type of accessed storage and allows for disambiguation
/// between different types of storage and different properties within a class.
///
/// AccessedStorage::compute() follows the same logic as getAccessBase(), but if
/// the base is not recognized as a valid access, it returns invalid
/// AccessedStorage. It also performs further analysis to determine the root
/// reference of an object access.
///
/// AccessedStorage::compute() returns the outermost AccessedStorage for any
/// memory address. It can be called on the address of a memory operation, the
/// address of a begin_access, or any other address value. If the address is
/// from an enforced begin_access or from any memory operation that is part of a
/// formal access, then it returns a valid AccessedStorage value. If the memory
/// operation is not part of a formal access, then it still identifies the
/// accessed storage as a best effort, but the result may be invalid storage.
///
///    An active goal is to require compute() to always return a
///    valid AccessedStorage value even for operations that aren't part of a
///    formal access.
///
/// The AccessEnforcementWMO pass is an example of an optimistic optimization
/// that relies on this requirement for correctness. If
/// AccessedStorage::compute() simply bailed out on an unrecognized memory
/// address by returning an invalid AccessedStorage, then the optimization could
/// make incorrect assumptions about the absence of access to globals or class
/// properties.
///
/// AccessedStorage::computeInScope() returns an AccessedStorage value for the
/// immediately enclosing access scope. Within a formal access, it always
/// returns a Nested storage kind, which provides the begin_access marker.
///
/// identifyFormalAccess() works like AccessedStorage::computeInScope(), but
/// finds the storage corresponding to a begin_access marker, rather than an
/// arbitrary address. This must return a valid AccessedStorage value unless the
/// access has "Unsafe" enforcement. The given begin_access marker may be nested
/// within another, outer access scope. For the purpose of exclusivity, nested
/// accesses are considered distinct formal accesses so they return distinct
/// AccessedStorage values even though they may access the same memory. This
/// way, nested accesses do not appear to conflict.
///
/// AccessPath identifies both the accessed storage and the path to a specific
/// storage location within that storage object. See ProgrammersGuide.md and the
/// class comments below for details. AccessPath::compute() and
/// AccessPath::computeInScope() mirror the AccessedStorage API.
/// AccessPath::contains() and AccessPath::mayOverlap() provide efficient
/// comparison of access paths.
///
/// AccessPath::collectUses() provides all reachable uses of the accessed
/// storage, allowing the selection of Exact, Inner, or Overlapping uses.
/// visitAccessedStorageUses() and visitAccessPathUses() generalize
/// handling of all reachable uses for a given storage location.
