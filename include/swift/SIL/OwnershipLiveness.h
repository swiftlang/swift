/// Terminology:
///
/// Linear lifetime: All paths through the value's definition to the
/// function exit pass through exactly one lifetime-ending operation.
///
/// Complete OSSA: All owned values and borrow introducers have linear lifetime.
///
/// Borrow introducer: defines a guaranteed SILValue and an associated explicit
/// borrow scope: begin_borrow, load_borrow, store_borrow, and reborrow.  A
/// "reborrow" is a guaranteed phi for which `isGuaranteedForwarding` returns
/// false. (Eventually, the phi will know whether it is a reborrow based on a
/// flag or subclass). Guaranteed function arguments do conceptually introduce
/// borrow scopes, but their scopes are implied by the function entry and
/// return points.
///
/// Completing an OSSA lifetime is the process of giving an owned value or a
/// borrow introducer a linear lifetime. This process may require phi creation
/// whenever a nested scope involves a guaranteed phi that is not dominated by
/// the outer scope's definition. A new phi will be created that ends the outer
/// lifetime and begins a new lifetime in the successor block. This new phi will
/// either forward an owned value or reborrow the outer borrow scope. The new
/// phi's lifetime will then be recursively extended over the lifetime of the
/// original guaranteed phi, which we refer to as its inner adjacent phi.
///
//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//
///
/// Linear SSA liveness:
///
/// - Liveness for a single "defining" owned value or borrow introducing value
///   assuming the value's lifetime is already linear.
///
/// - The definition dominates all use points (phis do not extend the lifetime)
///
/// - Only lifetime-ending operations generate liveness
///
/// - Oblivious to pointer escapes within the lifetime
///
///
/// Interior SSA liveness:
///
/// - Liveness for a single "defining" value with any ownership.
///
/// - The definition dominates all use points (phis do not extend the lifetime)
///
/// - Does not assume the current lifetime is linear. Transitively follows
///   guaranteed forwarding and address uses within the current scope.
///
/// - Liveness cannot extend beyond lifetime-ending operations
///   (a.k.a. affine lifetimes).
///
/// - Assumes inner scopes *are* linear, including borrow and address scopes
///   (e.g. begin_borrow, load_borrow, begin_apply, store_borrow, begin_access)
///   A callback may be used to complete inner scopes before updating liveness.
///
/// - Only returns AddressUseKind::PointerEscape if one of the uses of the
///   outer value has OperandOwnership::PointerEscape or
///   OperandOwnership::BitwiseEscape. An inner scope's guaranteed value may
///   escape without causing the outer scope's value to escape.
///
/// - Insulates outer scopes from inner scope details. Maintains the
///   invariant that inlining cannot pessimize optimization.
///
/// - Interior SSA liveness is used to complete (linearize) an OSSA lifetime
///
/// Interior liveness example:
///
///     %struct = struct ...
///     %f = struct_extract %s     // defines a guaranteed value (%f)
///     %b = begin_borrow %field
///     %a = ref_element_addr %b
///     _  = address_to_pointer %a
///     end_borrow %b              // the only interior use of %f
///
/// When computing interior liveness for %f, %b is an inner scope. Because inner
/// scopes are complete, the only relevant use is end_borrow %b. Despite the
/// address_to_pointer instruction, %f does not escape any dependent address.
///
/// Transitive SSA liveness
///
/// - Similar to Interior SSA liveness, but does not assume that any lifetimes
///   are linear. Transitively follows uses within inner scopes, recursively
///   through nested scopes, including forwarding operations and address uses.
///
/// - Much more likely to return AddressUseKind::PointerEscape
///
/// Transitive liveness example:
///
///     %struct = struct ...
///     %f = struct_extract %s     // defines a guaranteed value (%f)
///     %b = begin_borrow %field
///     %a = ref_element_addr %b
///     _  = address_to_pointer %a // a transitive use of %f escapes
///
/// When computing transitive liveness for %f, %b is an inner scope. Liveness
/// does not assume that an end_borrow exists. Instead it transitively considers
/// all uses of %b. As a result, %f escapes.
///
/// - This header provides no interface for transitive liveness because it is no
///   longer needed with complete OSSA lifetimes
///
/// Extended liveness
///
/// - Liveness of a single "defining" value extended beyond its lifetime-ending
///   operations.
///
/// - May refer to copy-extension, phi-extension, or extension over barriers
///   such as access markers.
///
/// - For phi-extension, the definition no longer dominates the use
///   points. MultiDefPrunedLiveness must be used. Each phi is added as a new
///   definition.
///
/// Extended linear liveness
///
/// - Extended liveness that only considers lifetime-ending operations. Assumes
///   the definition already has a linear lifetime and that any phis that end
///   the current lifetime also have linear lifetimes.
///
/// Extended interior liveness
///
/// - Like interior SSA liveness, does not assume the current lifetime is
///   linear. Transitively follows guaranteed forwarding and address uses within
///   the current scope. Assumes inner scopes *are* linear.
///
/// - Interior copy-extension is used to canonicalize an OSSA lifetime
///
/// - This header provides no interface for extended interior liveness because
///   it is highly specific to a particular task.
