///   merge is impossible since values can not have any ownership. Values with
///   ownership None are statically proven to be trivial values, often because
///   they are trivially typed, but sometimes because of path-sensitive
///   information like knowledge of an enum case. Trivial values have no
///   ownership semantics.

/// * OwnershipConstraint: This represents a constraint on the values that can
///   be used by a specific operand. Here Any is valid and is used for operands
///   that don't care about the ownership kind (lack ownership constraints). In
///   contrast, a constraint of None is the most restrictive. It requires a
///   trivial value. An Unowned, Owned, or Guaranteed constraint requires either
