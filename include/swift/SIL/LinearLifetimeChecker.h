/// A class used to validate linear lifetime with respect to an SSA-like
/// definition.
///
/// This class is able to both validate that a linear lifetime has been properly
/// constructed (for verification and safety purposes) as well as return to the
/// caller upon failure, what the failure was. In certain cases (for instance if
/// there exists a path without a non-consuming use), the class will report back
/// the specific insertion points needed to insert these compensating releases.
///
/// DISCUSSION: A linear lifetime consists of a starting block or instruction
/// and a list of non-consuming uses and a set of consuming uses. The consuming
/// uses must not be reachable from each other and jointly post-dominate all
/// consuming uses as well as the defining block/instruction.
