  /// Each location has a unique number which is index in the
  /// MemoryLifetime::locations array and the bit number in the bit sets.
  ///
  /// Locations can have sub-locations in case the parent location is a struct
  /// or tuple with fields/elements. So, each top-level location forms a
  /// tree-like data structure. Sub-locations are only created lazily, i.e. if
  /// struct/tuple elements are really accessed with struct/tuple_element_addr.
  ///
  /// As most alloc_stack locations only live within a single block, such
  /// single-block locations are not included in the "regular" data flow
  /// analysis (to not blow up the bit vectors). They are handled separately
  /// with a simple single-block data flow analysis, which runs independently
  /// for each block.
