///
///Some terminology for the following sections (and especially Driver.cpp):
///
/// BaseInput: a filename provided by the user, upstream of the entire Job
///            graph, usually denoted by an InputAction. Every Job has access,
///            during construction, to a set of BaseInputs that are upstream of
///            its inputs and input jobs in the job graph, and from which it can
///            derive PrimaryInput names for itself.
///
/// BaseOutput: a filename that is a non-temporary, output at the bottom of a
///             Job graph, and often (though not always) directly specified by
///             the user in the form of a -o or -emit-foo-path name, or an entry
///             in a user-provided OutputFileMap. May also be an auxiliary,
///             derived from a BaseInput and a type.
///
/// PrimaryInput: one of the distinguished inputs-to-act-on (as opposed to
///               merely informative additional inputs) to a Job. May be a
///               BaseInput but may also be a temporary that doesn't live beyond
///               the execution of the Job graph.
///
/// PrimaryOutput: an output file matched 1:1 with a specific
///                PrimaryInput. Auxiliary outputs may also be produced. A
///                PrimaryOutput may be a BaseOutput, but may also be a
///                temporary that doesn't live beyond the execution of the Job
///                graph (that is: it exists in order to be the PrimaryInput
///                for a subsequent Job).
///
/// The user-provided OutputFileMap lists BaseInputs and BaseOutputs, but doesn't
/// describe the temporaries inside the Job graph.
///
/// The Compilation's DerivedOutputFileMap (shared by all CommandOutputs) lists
/// PrimaryInputs and maps them to PrimaryOutputs, including all the
/// temporaries. This means that in a multi-stage Job graph, the BaseInput =>
/// BaseOutput entries provided by the user are split in two (or more) steps,
/// one BaseInput => SomeTemporary and one SomeTemporary => BaseOutput.
///
/// To try to keep this as simple as possible (it's already awful) we associate
/// every PrimaryInput 1:1 with a specific BaseInput from which it was derived;
/// this way a CommandOutput will have a vector of _pairs_ of
/// {Base,Primary}Inputs rather than a pair of separate vectors. This arrangement
/// appears to cover all the graph topologies we encounter in practice.
