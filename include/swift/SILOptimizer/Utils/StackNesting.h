///
/// This utility is useful for optimizations which create stack allocations
/// without caring about correct nesting with existing allocations. This may
/// result in code like
/// \code
///   %1 = alloc_stack
///     ...
///   %2 = alloc_stack
///     ...
///   dealloc_stack %1
///     ...
///   dealloc_stack %2
/// \endcode
///
/// The StackNesting utility is able to correct the code:
/// \code
///   %1 = alloc_stack
///     ...
///   %2 = alloc_stack
///     ...
///   dealloc_stack %2
///   dealloc_stack %1
/// \endcode
