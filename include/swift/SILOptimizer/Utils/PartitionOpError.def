/// An error created if we discover a value was locally used after it
/// was already sent.
///
/// The arguments in the type are:
///
/// 1. The PartitionOp that required the element to be alive.
///
/// 2. The element in the PartitionOp that was asked to be alive.
///
/// 3. The operand of the instruction that originally sent the region. Can be
/// used to get the immediate value sent or the sending instruction.
PARTITION_OP_ERROR(LocalUseAfterSend)

/// This is called if we detect a never sendable element that was actually sent.
///
/// E.x.: passing a main actor exposed value to a sending parameter.
PARTITION_OP_ERROR(SentNeverSendable)

/// This is emitted when a never sendable value is passed into a sending
/// result. The sending result will be viewed in our caller as disconnected and
/// able to be sent.
PARTITION_OP_ERROR(AssignNeverSendableIntoSendingResult)

/// This is emitted when an inout sending parameter has been sent in a function
/// body but has not been reinitialized at the end of the function.
PARTITION_OP_ERROR(InOutSendingNotInitializedAtExit)

/// This is emitted when an inout sending parameter has been assigned a
/// non-disconnected value (e.x.: a value exposed to main actor isolated code)
/// at end of function without being reinitialized with something disconnected.
PARTITION_OP_ERROR(InOutSendingNotDisconnectedAtExit)

/// Used to signify an "unknown code pattern" has occured while performing
/// dataflow.
///
/// DISCUSSION: Our dataflow cannot emit errors itself so this is a callback
/// to our user so that we can emit that error as we process.
PARTITION_OP_ERROR(UnknownCodePattern)

/// Used to signify that an isolation crossing function is returning a
/// non-Sendable value.
