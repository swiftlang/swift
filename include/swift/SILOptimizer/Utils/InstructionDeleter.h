///
/// Purpose:
///
/// 1. Avoid adding logic to passes to manually track dead code. This is one of
/// the most common sources of complexity and bugs when passes are composed of
/// multiple layers of utilities.
///
/// 2. Avoid passing InstModCallbacks across APIs. InstModCallbacks should be
/// instantiated very rarely within the implementation of a few utilities. It
/// should never need to passed across the utilities except at the very lowest
/// level. Callbacks are not actually composable. Chaining callbacks, and
/// keeping track of which callbacks are active and valid across code boundaries
/// is highly bug prone and infeasible.
///
/// 3. Fixup OSSA after deletion so SIL remains valid. Allowing OSSA to be
/// invalid across API boundaries creates an intractable problem and makes it
/// impossible to design composable OSSA utilities.
///
/// Strategies for SIL transformation:
///
/// 1. Defer deletion until the end of the pass/sub-pass. This is the simplest
/// strategy. Use it when possible. Use InstructionDeleter::trackIfDead() to
/// record instructions that may be the root of a dead use-def graph after
/// transformation. Use InstructionDeleter::cleanupDeadInstructions().
///
/// 2. For algorithms that delete instructions with side effects or require some
/// instructions and operands to be removed from the instruction list or use
/// list incrementally... Use InstructionDeleter::forceDeleteAndFixLifetimes()
/// This erases instructions even, if they have side-effects, and it leaves OSSA
/// in a valid state. This automatically tracks newly exposed dead code. Use
/// InstructionDeleter::cleanupDeadInstructions() at the end of the pass.
///
/// 3. For algorithms that benefit from incremental dead code elimination
/// because eliminating dead code may expose more optimization incrementally...
/// Use InstructionDeleter::forceDeleteAndFixLifetimes() as in case #2, but
/// simply invoke InstructionDeleter::cleanupDeadInstructions() whenever it is
/// useful to do so.
///
/// Instruction iterator invalidation:
///
/// It is surprisingly difficult for any transform to correctly update
/// instruction iterators during deletion. This is because deleting a single
/// instruction may require deleting other instructions, such as debug info and
/// scope-ending instructions. In OSSA code, deleting an instruction may even
/// cause new instructions to be inserted. This is best handled by acquiring an
/// UpdatingInstructionIterator from the InstructionDeleter. This is usually
/// done via InstructionDeleter::updatingRange(SILBasicBlock *).
/// InstructionDeleter::getIteratorRegistry().makeIterator() offers more
/// control.
///
/// Instruction pointer invalidation:
///
/// For data structures that contain instruction pointers and persist across
/// calls to forceDelete* or cleanupDeadInstructions... There is no need to
/// create an updating iterator. Simply check Instruction::isDeleted() when
/// retrieving a pointer from the data structure.
///
/// Using InstModCallbacks:
///
/// InstructionDeleted is primarily designed to be used with a single 'onDelete'
/// callback, which is invoked consistently just before deleting each
/// instruction. It's usually used to avoid iterator invalidation. The other
/// InstModCallbacks should generally be handled at a higher level, and avoided
/// altogether if possible. The following two are supported for flexibility:
///
/// callbacks.createdNewInst() is invoked incrementally when it fixes lifetimes
/// while deleting a set of instructions, but the SIL may still be invalid
/// relative to the new instruction.
///
/// callbacks.notifyWillBeDeletedFunc() is invoked when a dead instruction is
/// first recognized and was not already passed in by the client. During the
/// callback, the to-be-deleted instruction has valid SIL. It's operands and
/// uses can be inspected and cached. It will be deleted later during
/// cleanupDeadInstructions().
///
/// Note that the forceDelete* APIs only invoke notifyWillBeDeletedFunc() when
/// an operand's definition will become dead after force-deleting the specified
/// instruction. Some clients force-delete related instructions one at a
/// time. It is the client's responsiblity to invoke notifyWillBeDeletedFunc()
/// on those explicitly deleted instructions if needed.
