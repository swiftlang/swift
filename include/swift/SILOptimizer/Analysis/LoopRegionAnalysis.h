/// Purpose
/// =======
///
/// This is an analysis that is an implementation of interval analysis in order
/// to allow for dataflow to be done in a structured way on the loop tree. The
/// facilities it provides are:
///
/// 1. An abstraction called ``LoopRegion`` that abstracts over natural loops,
/// basic blocks, and the top level function. This is meant to provide a
/// function level pointer for summarizing information.
///
/// 2. For each Region, if it has subregions (i.e. is not a Block), an RPO
/// ordering of the Subregions are provided. Loops in this RPO ordering have the
/// RPO number of their header.
///
/// 3. Natural loops are defined by the loops that SILLoopInfo can find. Thus it
/// is useful to be able to know about loops that are not able to be found by
/// SILLoopInfo (i.e. irreducible loops). This information is computed by
/// finding all backedges and any backedge that is not recognized by SILLoopInfo
/// as a backedge has its head and tail region marked as unknown control flow
/// boundaries. This can be queries via the methods:
///
/// - LoopRegion::isUnknownControlFlowEdgeHead().
/// - LoopRegion::isUnknownControlFlowEdgeTail().
///
/// 4. Only loops with single back edges are supported by this analysis. If such
/// a loop is detected, we mark the head, tail of the edge as irreducible
/// control flow boundaries. To handle such loops, we rely on loop
/// canonicalization to transform the multiple backedge loops into multiple
/// loops with singular backedges or by merging the backedge blocks.
///
/// Algorithm
/// =========
///
/// The main consideration here is that we want to ensure that we only traverse
/// the CFG once and reuse the information that is already provided via the loop
/// info analysis and the post order analysis.
///
/// We begin by visiting each block in RPO order. During this RPO traversal, we:
///
/// 1. Create LoopRegions for each block and wire up each block's predecessor
/// and successor blocks as predecessors/successors of the block's region.
///
/// 2. Detect any backedges that are unknown to SILLoopInfo and mark the blocks
/// that form the head/tail of the backedge as unknown control flow boundaries.
///
/// 3. We lookup/create the region for the innermost loop that contains the
/// block and add the block's region as a subregion of that loop.
///
/// Then we perform a postorder DFS of the loop nest. The postorder provides the
/// inductive rule that all loops will be visited after all of their subloops
/// have been visited. If a Loop has no subloops (i.e. all subregions are
/// blocks), we do nothing. Otherwise, if the loop does have subloops, we visit
/// each subloop and do the following:
///
/// 1. The region data structure of the header of the subloop still is the
/// successor of its predecessor outside of the subloop in the various block
/// datastructures. Rewire those regions to consider the loop to be their
/// successor instead and make each of those regions on of the predecessors of
/// the subloop. Then clear the predecessor list of the subloop's header
/// region. The header should have no predecessor edges after this operation
/// completes.
///
/// 2. For each of the exiting regions of the subloop (that is the regions
/// inside the loop that leave the subloop):
///
///   a. Replace each predecessor edge in the exiting block's successors with an
///   edge pointing at the subloop instead of at the exiting block and
///   vis-a-versa.
///
///   b. Introduce a loop-escape edge from the exiting regions that associates
///   the specific successor number of the region with the loop successor edge
///   that we just created. By using this indirection, if the loop is an inner
///   loop and further acts as an exit from an outer loop, the region's
///   successor edge will be able to be used to traverse from the region ->
///   inner loop -> outer loop successor. (i).
///
/// After this is complete, the exiting blocks should have no successor edges
/// going outside the loop. For each of the removed edges additionally we
/// introduce an "exiting edge". The reason this is necessary is to make it
/// easier to handle exits through
///
/// 3. If the loop has multiple back edges, mark each of the backedges as
/// unknown control flow boundaries.
///
/// We complete by performing the same operation on the top level function.
///
/// After this is done, each level of the loop hierarchy should be able to be
/// treated from a dataflow perspective as its own separate function with only
/// one caller, the parent loop region (or the top level function), enabling
/// extremely aggressive operations (or even outlining).
///
/// (i).  The reason why this is important is to be able to handle exits to
/// trapping code. Trapping code will always be associated with the outer most
/// loop since it is an exit from all of the loops. Yet in ARC we need to be
/// able to find that region from For certain optimizations like ARC, we need to
/// be able to ignore these successor regions. By tracing up the loop nest
/// hierarchy by these loop exits, we can find the unreachable regions in the
/// parent and ignore them. This also allows us to be more precise about
/// hoisting retains/releases and avoid hoisting into such regions.
