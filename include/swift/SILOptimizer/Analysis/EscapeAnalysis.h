/// EscapeAnalysis provides information about whether the lifetime of an object
/// exceeds the scope of a function.
///
/// We compute escape analysis by building a connection graph for each
/// function. For interprocedural analysis the connection graphs are merged
/// in bottom-up order of the call graph.
/// The idea is based on "Escape analysis for Java." by J.-D. Choi, M. Gupta, M.
/// Serrano, V. C. Sreedhar, and S. Midkiff
/// http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/320384.320386
///
/// This design is customized for SIL and the Swift memory model as follows:
///
/// Each SILValue holding a memory address or object reference is mapped to a
/// node in the connection graph. The node's type depends on the value's
/// origin. SILArguments have "argument" type. Locally allocated storage and
/// values of unknown origin have "value" type. Loaded values have "content"
/// type. A "return" type node represents the returned value and has no
/// associated SILValue.
///
/// "Content" nodes are special in that they represent the identity of some set
/// of memory locations. Content nodes are created to represent the memory
/// pointed to by one of the other node types. So, except for loads, SILValues
/// do not directly map to content nodes. For debugging purposes only, content
/// nodes do refer back to the SILValue that originally pointed to them. When
/// content nodes are merged, only one of those SILValue back-references is
/// arbitrarily preserved. The content of the returned value is the only content
/// node that has no back-reference to a SILValue.
///
/// This code:
///   let a = SomeClass()
///   return a
///
/// Generates the following connection graph, where 'a' is in the SILValue %0:
///   Val [ref] %1 Esc: R, Succ: (%1)   // Reference 'a'; points to 'a's object
///   Con [int] %2 Esc: R, Succ: (%2.1) // Object pointed to by 'a'
///   Con %2.1 Esc: G, Succ:            // Fields in the object
///   Ret  Esc: R, Succ: %0             // The returned value, aliased with 'a'
///
/// Each node has an escaping state: None, (R)eturn, (A)rguments, or (G)lobal.
/// These states form a lattice in which None is the most refined, or top, state
/// and Global is the least refined, or bottom, state. Merging nodes performs a
/// meet operation on their escaping states, moving the state down in the
/// lattice. At a call site, the callee graph is merged with the caller graph by
/// merging the respective call argument nodes. A node has a "Return" escaping
/// state if it only escapes by being returned from the current function. A node
/// has an "Argument" escaping state if only escapes by being passed as an
/// incoming argument to this function.
///
/// A directed edge between two connection graph nodes indicates that the memory
/// represented by the destination node memory is reachable via an address
/// contained in the source node. A node may only have one "pointsTo" edge,
/// whose destination is always a content node. Additional "defer" edges allow a
/// form of aliasing between nodes. A single content node represents any and all
/// memory that any other node may point to. This content node can be found by
/// following any path of defer edges until the path terminates in a pointsTo
/// edge. The final pointsTo edge refers to the representative content node, and
/// all such paths in the graph must reach the same content node. To maintain
/// this invariant, the algorithm that builds the connection graph must
/// incrementally merge content nodes.
///
/// Note that a defer edge may occur between any node types. A value node that
/// holds a reference may defer to another value or content node whose value was
/// merged via a phi; a content node that holds a reference may defer to a value
/// node that was stored into the content; a content node may defer to another
/// content node that was loaded and stored.
///
/// Now consider the same example, but declaring a 'var' instead of a 'let':
///
///   var a = SomeClass()
///   return a
///
/// Generates the following connection graph, where the alloc_stack for variable
/// 'a' is in the SILValue %0 and class allocation returns SILValue %3.
///
///   Val %0 Esc: , Succ: (%0.1)        // Stack address of 'a'
///   Con [ref] %0.1 Esc: , Succ: %3    // Local reference 'a', aliased with %3
///   Val [ref] %3 Esc: , Succ: (%4)    // Local instance 'a', stored in %0.1
///   Con [int] %4 Esc: G, Succ: (%4.1) // Object, escapes
///   Con %4.1 Esc: G, Succ:            // Fields, escapes
///   Ret  Esc: , Succ: (%4), %3
///
/// The value node for variable 'a' now points to local variable storage
/// (%0.1). That local variable storage contains a reference. Assignment into
/// that reference creates a defer edge to the allocated reference (%3). The
/// allocated reference in turn points to the object storage (%4).
///
/// Note that a variable holding a single class reference and a variable holding
/// a non-trivial struct will have the same graph representation. A '[ref]' flag
/// on a node indicates that the all pointer-type fields that may be stored
/// inside the memory represented by that node are references. This allows alias
/// analysis to assume the object the node points to will not be released when
/// the node's memory is released as long as there are subsequent accesses to
/// the object accessed via a different path in the connection graph.
///
/// A pointsTo edge does not necessarily indicate pointer indirection. It may
/// simply represent a derived address within the same object. A node that
/// points to the same logical object must be flagged as an interior node
/// ('[int]'). Interior nodes always have pointsTo content representing the rest
/// of the object. This allows escape analysis to view an object's memory in
/// layers, each with separate escaping properties. For example, a class
/// object's first-level content node represents the object header including the
/// metadata pointer and reference count. An object's second level content node
/// only represents the reference-holding fields within that object. Consider
/// the connection graph for a class with properties:
///
///   class HasObj {
///     var obj: AnyObject
///   }
///   func assignProperty(h: HasObj, o: AnyObject) {
///     h.obj = o
///   }
///
/// Which generates this graph where the argument 'h' is %0, and 'o' is %1:
///
///   Arg [ref] %0 Esc: A, Succ: (%6)     // 'h'
///   Arg [ref] %1 Esc: A, Succ: (%1.1)   // 'o'
///   Con [int] %1.1 Esc: A, Succ: (%1.2) // 'o' object
///   Con %1.2 Esc: A, Succ: (%1.3)       // 'o' fields
///   Con %1.3 Esc: G, Succ:              // memory 'h.obj' may point to
///   Con [int] %6 Esc: A, Succ: (%7)     // 'h' object
///   Con %7 Esc: A, Succ: %1             // 'h.obj'
///
/// Node %1.1 represents the header of 'o', including reference count and
/// metadata pointer. This node points to %1.2 which represents the 'obj'
/// property. '%1.3' represents any potential nontrivial properties in 'o' which
/// may have escaped globally when 'o' was released. '%6' is a ref_element_addr
/// accessing 'h.obj'. '%7' is a load of 'h.obj'. The assignment 'h.obj = o'
/// creates a defer edge from '%7' to '%1'.
///
/// The connection graph is constructed by summarizing all memory operations in
/// a flow-insensitive way. Hint: ConGraph->viewCG() displays the Dot-formatted
/// connection graph.
///
/// In addition to the connection graph, EscapeAnalysis caches information about
/// "use points". Each release operation in which the released reference can be
/// identified is a considered a use point. The use point instructions are
/// recorded in a table and given an ID. Each connection graph content node
/// stores a bitset indicating the use points that may release references that
/// point to by that content node. Correctness relies on an invariant: for each
/// reference-type value in the function, all points in the function which may
/// release the reference must be identified as use points of the node that the
/// value points to. If the reference-type value may be released any other
/// way, then its content node must be marked escaping.
