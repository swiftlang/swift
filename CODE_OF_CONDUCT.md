# Code of Conduct
To be a truly great community, Swift.org needs to welcome developers from all walks of life,
with different backgrounds, and with a wide range of experience. A diverse and friendly
community will have more great ideas, more unique perspectives, and produce more great 
code. We will work diligently to make the Swift community welcoming to everyone.

To give clarity of what is expected of our members, Swift.org has adopted the code of conduct 
defined by [contributor-covenant.org](https://www.contributor-covenant.org). This document is used across many open source 
communities, and we think it articulates our values well. The full text is copied below:

### Contributor Code of Conduct v1.3
As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and 
welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting 
issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, 
and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for 
everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual 
orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or 
nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Personal attacks
- Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing other’s private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Other unethical or unprofessional conduct

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, 
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of 
Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they 
deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and 
consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project. Project 
maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed 
from the project team.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an 
individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by 
contacting a project maintainer at [conduct@swift.org](mailto:conduct@swift.org). All complaints will be reviewed and 
investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the 
circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter 
of an incident.

*This policy is adapted from the Contributor Code of Conduct [version 1.3.0](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/).*

### Reporting
A working group of community members is committed to promptly addressing any [reported 
issues](mailto:conduct@swift.org). Working group members are volunteers appointed by the project lead, with a 
preference for individuals with varied backgrounds and perspectives. Membership is expected 
to change regularly, and may grow or shrink.
