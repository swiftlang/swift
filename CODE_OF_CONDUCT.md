## Welcome Developers

To be a truly great community, Swift.org needs to welcome developers from all walks of life, with different backgrounds, and with a wide range of experience. A diverse and friendly community will have more great ideas, more unique perspectives, and produce more great code. We will work diligently to make the Swift community welcoming to everyone.

To give clarity of what is expected of our members, Swift.org is based on the code of conduct defined by contributor-covenant.org. This document is used across many open source communities, and we think it articulates our values well.

## Contributor Code of Conduct v1.4

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

    Using welcoming and inclusive language (e.g., prefer non-gendered words like “folks” to “guys”, non-ableist words like “soundness check” to “sanity check”, etc.).
    Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
    Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
    Focusing on what is best for the community.
    Showing empathy towards other community members.

### Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

    The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
    Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
    Public or private harassment.
    Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
    Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Project maintainers

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Code of Conduct applications

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces managed by Swift.org, including (but not limited to) source code repositories, bug trackers, web sites, documentation, and online forums. It also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Behavior for moderation

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting a member of the Swift Core Team or by flagging the behavior for moderation (e.g., in the Forums), whether you are the target of that behavior or not. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. The site of the disputed behavior is usually not an acceptable place to discuss moderation decisions, and moderators may move or remove any such discussion.

## Moderation action

Project maintainers are held to a higher standard, and project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership. If you disagree with a moderation action, you can appeal to the Core Team (or individual Core Team members) privately.
