/*
 This file tests the early features of the flow-sensitive Sendable checking implemented by the SendNonSendable SIL pass.
 In particular, it tests the behavior of applications that cross isolation domains:
 - non-Sendable values are statically grouped into "regions" of values that may alias or point to each other
 - passing a non-Sendable value to an isolation-crossing call "consumed" the region of that value
 - accessing a non-Sendable value requires its region to have not been consumed

 All non-Sendable arguments, and "self" for non-Sendable classes, are assumed to be in the same region at the start of
 each function, and that region must be preserved at all times - it cannot be passed to another isolation domain.
