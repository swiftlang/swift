// Welcome, Build Wrangler!
//
// This file lists APIs that are unique to stdlib builds with assertions.
// (It is combined with the stability-stdlib-abi-without-asserts.test file
// to generate a full list of potentially breaking API changes. In most cases
// you'll want to edit that file instead of this one.)
//
// A failure in this test indicates that there is a potential breaking change in
// the Standard Library. If you observe a failure outside of a PR test, please
// reach out to the Standard Library team directly to make sure this gets
// resolved quickly! If your own PR fails in this test, you probably have an
// ABI- or source-breaking change in your commits. Please go and fix it.
//
// Please DO NOT DISABLE THIS TEST. In addition to ignoring the current set of
// ABI breaks, XFAILing this test also silences any future ABI breaks that may
// land on this branch, which simply generates extra work for the next person
// that picks up the mess.
//
// Instead of disabling this test, consider extending the list of expected
// changes at the bottom. (You'll also need to do this if your own PR triggers
// false positives, or if you have special permission to break things.) You can
// find a diff of what needs to be added in the output of the failed test run.
// The order of lines doesn't matter, and you can also include comments to refer
// to any bugs you filed.
//
// Thank you for your help ensuring the stdlib remains compatible with its past!
//                                            -- Your friendly stdlib engineers

// REQUIRES: CPU=x86_64 || CPU=arm64
// NOTE: This test runs both on intel and arm, and so far no differences have been spotted,
//       so for better developer experience on apple silicon macs at desk we don't require a specific architecture.
//       If there were to be a case where it fails on one of the platforms, we'd have to potentially split out into an arm baseline file.
