/*
 * This is a configuration file for the 'lit' test runner. It takes the
 * Features.def for the language and creates 'lit' features associated with
 * them when the Swift feature is available. It allows using
 * `REQUIRES: FeatureName` instead of `REQUIRES: asserts`, which tend to be
 * left behind when the Swift feature becomes non-experimental.
 *
 * This file is preprocessed the Clang preprocessor and generates Python files.
 * C comments are possible, but not Python comments (they look like preprocessor
 * statements).
