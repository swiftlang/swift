//
// This file provides utilities for SSA def-use and use-def walking.
// There are four walker protocols:
// * for both directions: down (= def-use) and up (= use-def)
// * for values and addresses
// ```
//   protocol ValueDefUseWalker
//   protocol AddressDefUseWalker
//   protocol ValueUseDefWalker
//   protocol AddressUseDefWalker
// ```
//
// To use a walker, just conform to one (or multiple) of those protocols.
// There are several ways to configure the walker by providing implementations of
// their protocol functions. For details see the protocol definitions.
// The value-walkers also require to provide a "cache" property - see `WalkerCache`.
//
// The walkers maintain a "path" during the walk, which in it's simplest form can
// just be a SmallProjectionPath. For details see `WalkingPath`.

/// - A `DefUseWalker` finds all uses of a target value.

///   2. If the projection path is non-empty (`"s0.1.e3"`), then the target value is the one
///     reachable from the initial value through the series of projections described by the path.
/// - A path can also contain a pattern such as `"v**"` which means any series of "value"
///   projections (excluding `ref_element_addr` and similar, i.e. `c*`) from any field.
///   In the `v**` case, the target value*s* are many, i.e. all the ones reachable from
///   the initial value through _any of the fields_ through _any number_ of value projections.
///   `c*` means values reachable through a _single_ projection of _any_ of the fields of the class.
///
/// - A walk is started with a call to `walkDownUses(initial, path: path)`.
/// - This function will call `walkDown(operand, path: path)`
///   for every use of `initial` as `operand` in an instruction.
/// - For each use, then the walk can continue with initial value the result if the result of the using
///   instruction might still reach the target value with a new projection path.
///   1. If the use is a construction such as a
///     `%res = struct $S (%f0)` (or `%res = tuple (%unk, %1)`) instruction and the path is `p`
///     then the `%res` result value reaches the target value through the new projection`s0.p` (respectively `1.p`).
///   2.  If the use is a projection such as `%res = struct_extract %s : $S, #S.field0` and the
///     path is `s0.s1` then the target value is reachable from `%res` with path `s1`.
///     If the path doesn't match `unmatchedPath` is called.
///   3. If the use is a "forwarding instruction", such as a cast, the walk continues with the same path.
///   4. If the use is an unhandled instruction then `leafUse` is called to denote that the client has to
///     handle this use.
///
/// There are two types of DefUseWalkers, one for values (`ValueDefUseWalker`) and one for
/// addresses (`AddressDefUseWalker`)


/// A `ValueDefUseWalker` can only handle "value" initial values, which correspond
/// to types that are not addresses, i.e. _do not have_ an asterisk (`*`) in the textual
/// representation of their SIL type (`$T`).
/// These can be values of reference type, or struct/tuple etc.
/// A `ValueDefUseWalker.walkDownDefault` called on a use of a initial "value" which
/// yields an "address" value (such as `ref_element_addr %initial_value`) will call `leafUse`
/// since the walk can't proceed.
///
/// Example call `walkDownUses(%str, path: "s0.s1")`
/// ```
/// %fa    = struct_extract %str  : $S1, #S1.fa   // 1. field 0, walkDownUses(%fa, "s1")
/// %fb    = struct_extract %str  : $S1, #S1.fb   // 5. field 1, unmatchedPath(%str, "s0.s1")
/// %fa.ga = struct_extract %fa   : $S2, #S2.ga   // 2. field 1, walkDownUses(%fa.ga, "")
/// ...    = struct_extract %fa.ga: $S3, #S3.ha   // 3. empty path, unmatchedPath(%fa.ga, "")
/// ...    = <instruction>  %fa.ga:               // 4. unknown instruction, leafUse(%fa.ga, "")
/// ...    = <instruction>  %str:                 // 6. unknown instruction, leafUse(%str, "s0.s1")

/// - A `UseDefWalker` can be used to find all "generating" definitions of
///   a target value.
/// - A target value is described by an "initial" value and a projection path as in a `DefUseWalker.`
///   1. If the projection path is empty (`""`) then the target value is the initial value itself.
///   2. If the projection path is non-empty (`"s0.1.e3"`), then the target value is the one
///     reachable through the series of projections described by the path, applied to the initial value.
/// - The same notes about wildcard paths in `DefUseWalker` apply here.
///
/// - A walk is started with a call to `walkUp(initial, path: path)`.
///
/// - The implementor of `walkUp` can then track the definition if needed and
///   continue the walk by calling `walkUpDefault`.
///   `walkUpDefault` will do the following:
///   1. If the instruction of the definition is a projection, then it will continue
///     the walk by calling `walkUp` on the operand definition and an adjusted (pushed) path
///     to reflect that a further projection is needed to reach the value of interest from the new initial value.
///   2. If the instruction of the definition is a value construction such as `struct` and
///     the head of the path matches the instruction type then the walk continues
///     with a call to `walkUp` with initial value the operand definition denoted by the path
///     and the suffix path as path since the target value can now be reached with fewer projections.
///     If the defining instruction of the value does not match the head of the path as in
///     `%t = tuple ...` and `"s0.t1"` then `unmatchedPath(%t, ...)` is called.
///   3. If the instruction is a forwarding instruction, such as a cast, the walk continues with `walkUp`
///     with the operand definition as initial value and same path.
///   4. If the instruction is not handled by this walker or the path is empty, then `rootDef` is called to
///     denote that the walk can't continue and that the definition of the target has been reached.
