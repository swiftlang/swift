# This file defines availability macros mapping Swift releases to ABI stable
# OS releases that include the corresponding Swift Standard Library version.
#
# The macros defined here are available for use in all Swift libraries and swift
# lit tests defined in this repository. They can be used in place of a full
# version constraint list in `@available` attributes. That is to say, instead of
#
#     @available(macOS 10.15.4, iOS 13.4, watchOS 6.2, tvOS 13.4, *)
#
# we can write
#
#     @available(SwiftStdlib 5.2, *)
#
# Comments in this file start with `#`. Comments and empty lines are ignored.
# Each of the remaining lines must define an availability macro in the same
# format used by the `-define-availability` frontend command line option.

# NOTE: The build system will define another macro, StdlibDeploymentTarget, for
#       each SwiftStdlib macro defined in this file.  The difference between the
#       two is the the StdlibDeploymentTarget macro will never be set to a
#       higher version than the machine on which we are building.
#
#       This is to allow for use of new functions and types within the standard
#       libraries, in such a way that these usages will work on our CI machines.

# 9999 is the generic unknown future Swift release. It always needs to resolve
# to the special placeholder version numbers 9999.

SwiftStdlib 9999:macOS 9999, iOS 9999, watchOS 9999, tvOS 9999

# The last entry in this list corresponds to the Swift version currently under
# development. This usually resolves to placeholder version numbers (9999) until
# the corresponding operating systems get announced.
