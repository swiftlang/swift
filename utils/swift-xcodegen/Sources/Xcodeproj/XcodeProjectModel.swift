/*
 A very simple rendition of the Xcode project model.  There is only sufficient
 functionality to allow creation of Xcode projects in a somewhat readable way,
 and serialization to .xcodeproj plists.  There is no consistency checking to
 ensure, for example, that build settings have valid values, dependency cycles
 are not created, etc.
 
 Everything here is geared toward supporting project generation.  The intended
 usage model is for custom logic to build up a project using Xcode terminology
 (e.g. "group", "reference", "target", "build phase"), but there is almost no
 provision for modifying the model after it has been built up.  The intent is
 to create it as desired from the start.
 
 Rather than try to represent everything that Xcode's project model supports,
 the approach is to start small and to add functionality as needed.
 
 Note that this API represents only the project model â€” there is no notion of
 workspaces, schemes, etc (although schemes are represented individually in a
 separate API).  The notion of build settings is also somewhat different from
 what it is in Xcode:  instead of an open-ended mapping of build configuration
 names to dictionaries of build settings, here there is a single set of common
 build settings plus two overlay sets for debug and release.  The generated
 project has just the two Debug and Release configurations, created by merging
 the common set into the release and debug sets.  This allows a more natural
 configuration of the settings, since most values are the same between Debug
 and Release.  Also, the build settings themselves are represented as structs
 of named fields, instead of dictionaries with arbitrary name strings as keys.
 
 It is expected that some of these simplifications will need to be lifted over
 time, based on need.  That should be done carefully, however, to avoid ending
 up with an overly complicated model.
 
 Some things that are incomplete in even this first model:
 - copy files build phases are incomplete
 - shell script build phases are incomplete
 - file types in file references are specified using strings; should be enums
 so that the client doesn't have to hardcode the mapping to Xcode file type
 identifiers
 - debug and release settings override common settings; they should be merged
 in a way that respects `$(inhertied)` when the same setting is defined in
 common and in debug or release
 - there is no good way to control the ordering of the `Products` group in the
 main group; it needs to be added last in order to appear after the other
 references
