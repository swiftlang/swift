# 1. We have lto object files for swift in our build tree. We swift and libswiftdemangle.
# 2. These lto output files all have line tables in the swift include directory,
#    but do not have full debug info. To check for the latter case, we look for
#    SmallVector a commonly used data type.
# 3. We use swift-demangle since it is a much smaller executable than all of
