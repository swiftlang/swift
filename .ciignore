# This file specifies filename patterns that are used by the pull request
# testing infrastructure to determine if it is safe to skip building and
# testing against a given change in this repository.
#
# A change is considered safe only if it is exclusive to files that match
# a pattern in this file. However, changes to this file are not considered
# safe.
#
# Lines starting with '#' are comments. Otherwise, each line is a single
# case-sensitive filename pattern. The '*' and '?' Unix shell-style
# wildcards are supported. Note that either wildcard will match a period.
