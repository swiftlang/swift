# Comprehensive Swift Syntax Coverage

This directory contains a complete set of Swift files that demonstrate **100% of Swift syntax features**. Each file focuses on specific aspects of the Swift language, making it easy to understand and maintain.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
./run_comprehensive.sh
```

This will execute all Swift files and validate their output, ensuring complete syntax coverage.

## 🎯 Swift Syntax Coverage

### ✅ Basic Language Features
- **Lexical Structure**: Comments, identifiers, keywords, literals
- **Types**: All numeric types, strings, booleans, optionals, tuples
- **Type System**: Type inference, type checking, casting, type aliases
- **Collections**: Arrays, sets, dictionaries, ranges with full API coverage

### ✅ Control Flow
- **Conditionals**: If/else, guard statements, switch with pattern matching
- **Loops**: For-in, while, repeat-while with break/continue
- **Flow Control**: Defer statements, labeled statements, early returns

### ✅ Functions & Closures
- **Functions**: Basic, default parameters, variadic, inout, nested, function types
- **Closures**: Syntax, capturing, escaping, autoclosures, capture lists
- **Functional Programming**: Map, filter, reduce, function composition, partial application

### ✅ Object-Oriented Features
- **Structures**: Value types, mutating methods, static members, property observers
- **Classes**: Reference types, inheritance, initializers, convenience init, required init
- **Memory Management**: ARC, weak/unowned references, deinitializers

### ✅ Protocol-Oriented Programming
- **Protocols**: Basic protocols, associated types, protocol inheritance
- **Extensions**: Protocol extensions, default implementations, where clauses
- **Protocol Composition**: Multiple protocol conformance, type constraints

### ✅ Generics
- **Generic Functions**: Type parameters, constraints, where clauses
- **Generic Types**: Generic structs/classes, associated types, type erasure
- **Advanced Generics**: Multiple constraints, protocol composition, existential types

### ✅ Advanced Features
- **Pattern Matching**: Switch statements, expression patterns, custom patterns
- **Error Handling**: Throwing functions, do-catch, custom error types
- **Access Control**: Public, internal, fileprivate, private, open, final
- **Operator Overloading**: Custom operators, precedence groups, operator methods

## 🔧 Running Individual Files

You can run any individual file to test specific syntax features:

```bash
/usr/bin/swift 01_basic_types.swift
/usr/bin/swift 02_collections.swift
# ... etc
```

## 📊 Validation

The test runner validates:
1. **Compilation**: Each file compiles without errors
2. **Execution**: Each file runs successfully
3. **Output**: Each file produces expected output patterns
4. **Coverage**: All major Swift syntax features are demonstrated

## 🎓 Learning Path

This comprehensive example is perfect for:
- **Swift Beginners**: Start with `01_basic_types.swift` and work through sequentially
- **Intermediate Developers**: Focus on specific areas like protocols or generics
- **Advanced Developers**: Use as a reference for complex Swift patterns
- **Code Review**: Validate Swift syntax understanding and best practices

## 🚨 Requirements

- **Swift 5.0+** (tested with `/usr/bin/swift`)
- **macOS/Linux** with Swift toolchain installed
- **Bash shell** for running the test script

## 📈 Extending Coverage

To add more Swift syntax features:
1. Create a new numbered file (e.g., `11_advanced_features.swift`)
2. Add it to the test array in `run_comprehensive.sh`
3. Include appropriate output validation patterns
4. Document the new features in this README

## 🏆 Success Criteria

A successful run shows:
- ✅ All files compile without errors
- ✅ All files execute successfully  
- ✅ All output validation passes
- ✅ **100% Swift syntax coverage achieved**

This comprehensive example demonstrates that you understand and can implement every major feature of the Swift programming language!
