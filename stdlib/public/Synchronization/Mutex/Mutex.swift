/// A synchronization primitive that protects shared mutable state via
/// mutual exclusion.
///
/// The `Mutex` type offers non-recursive exclusive access to the state
/// it is protecting by blocking threads attempting to acquire the lock.
/// Only one execution context at a time has access to the value stored
/// within the `Mutex` allowing for exclusive access.
///
/// An example use of `Mutex` in a class used simultaneously by many
/// threads protecting a `Dictionary` value:
///
///     class Manager {
///       let cache = Mutex<[Key: Resource]>([:])
///
///       func saveResource(_ resource: Resource, as key: Key) {
///         cache.withLock {
///           $0[key] = resource
///         }
///       }
///     }
