// __extendhfxf2
//
// On Darwin platforms, these are provided by the host compiler-rt, but we
// can't depend on that everywhere, so we have to provide them in the Swift
// runtime. Calls to these symbols are automatically generated by LLVM when
// operating on Float16, so they are used *even though they appear to have
// no call sites anywhere in Swift*.
//
// These may require different naming or mangling on other targets; what I've
// setup here is correct for Linux/x86.

// Android NDK <r21 do not provide `__aeabi_d2h` in the compiler runtime,
// provide shims in that case.
