// General Mutable, Value-Type Collections
// =================================================
//
// Implementation notes
// ====================
//
// `Dictionary` uses two storage schemes: native storage and Cocoa storage.
//
// Native storage is a hash table with open addressing and Robin Hood probing.
// The bucket array forms a logical ring (e.g., a chain can wrap around the end
// of buckets array to the beginning of it).
//
// The logical bucket array is implemented as three arrays: Key, Value, and a
// bitmap that marks valid entries. An invalid entry marks the end of a chain.
// There is always at least one invalid entry among the buckets. `Dictionary`
// does not use tombstones.
//
// In addition to the native storage, `Dictionary` can also wrap an
// `NSDictionary` in order to allow bridging `NSDictionary` to `Dictionary` in
// `O(1)`.
//
// Currently native storage uses a data structure like this::
//
//   Dictionary<K,V> (a struct)
//   +------------------------------------------------+
//   |  _VariantDictionaryBuffer<K,V> (an enum)      |
//   | +--------------------------------------------+ |
//   | | [_NativeDictionaryBuffer<K,V> (a struct)] | |
//   | +---|----------------------------------------+ |
//   +----/-------------------------------------------+
//       /
//      |
//      V  _RawNativeDictionaryStorage (a class)  
//   +-----------------------------------------------------------+
//   | capacity                                                  |
//   | count                                                     |
//   | ptrToBits                                                 |
//   | ptrToKeys                                                 |
//   | ptrToValues                                               |
//   | [inline array of bits indicating whether bucket is set ]  |
//   | [inline array of keys                                  ]  |
//   | [inline array of values                                ]  |
//   +-----------------------------------------------------------+
//
//
// Cocoa storage uses a data structure like this::
//
//   Dictionary<K,V> (a struct)
//   +----------------------------------------------+
//   | _VariantDictionaryBuffer<K,V> (an enum)     |
//   | +----------------------------------------+   |
//   | | [ _CocoaDictionaryBuffer (a struct) ] |   |
//   | +---|------------------------------------+   |
//   +-----|----------------------------------------+

//   |   |  _CocoaDictionaryIndex (a struct) |

//
//
// The Native Kinds of Storage
// ---------------------------
//
// There are three different classes that can provide a native backing storage: 
// * `_RawNativeDictionaryStorage`
// * `_TypedNativeDictionaryStorage<K, V>`                   (extends Raw)
// * `_HashableTypedNativeDictionaryStorage<K: Hashable, V>` (extends Typed)
//
// (Hereafter RawStorage, TypedStorage, and HashableStorage, respectively)
//
// In a less optimized implementation, the parent classes could
// be eliminated, as they exist only to provide special-case behaviors.
// HashableStorage has everything a full implementation of a Dictionary
// requires, and is subsequently able to provide a full NSDictionary 
// implementation. Note that HashableStorage must have the `K: Hashable` 
// constraint because the NSDictionary implementation can't be provided in a 
// constrained extension.
//
// In normal usage, you can expect the backing storage of a Dictionary to be a 
// NativeStorage.
//
// TypedStorage is distinguished from HashableStorage to allow us to create a
// `_NativeDictionaryBuffer<AnyObject, AnyObject>`. Without the Hashable 
// requirement, such a Buffer is restricted to operations which can be performed
// with only the structure of the Storage: indexing and iteration. This is used
// in _SwiftDeferredNSDictionary to construct twin "native" and "bridged"
// storage. Key-based lookups are performed on the native storage, with the
// resultant index then used on the bridged storage.
//
// The only thing that TypedStorage adds over RawStorage is an implementation of
// deinit, to clean up the AnyObjects it stores. Although it nominally 
// inherits an NSDictionary implementation from RawStorage, this implementation 
// isn't useful and is never used. 
//
// RawStorage exists to allow a type-punned empty singleton Storage to be 
// created. Any time an empty Dictionary is created, this Storage is used. If 
// this type didn't exist, then NativeBuffer would have to store a Storage that 
// declared its actual type parameters. Similarly, the empty singleton would 
// have to declare its actual type parameters. If the singleton was, for 
// instance, a `HashableStorage<(), ()>`, then it would be a violation of 
// Swift's strict aliasing rules to pass it where a `HashableStorage<Int, Int>`
// was expected.
//
// It's therefore necessary for several types to store a RawStorage, rather than
// a TypedStorage, to allow for the possibility of the empty singleton. 
// RawStorage also provides an implementation of an always-empty NSDictionary.
//
//
// Index Invalidation
// ------------------
//
// Indexing a container, `c[i]`, uses the integral offset stored in the index
// to access the elements referenced by the container. Generally, an index into
// one container has no meaning for another. Indices are invalidated on
// insertion and deletion. However, copy-on-write that only updates values for
// existing keys preserves indices.
//
//   var (i, found) = d.find(k) // i is associated with d's storage
//   if found {
//      var e = d             // now d is sharing its data with e
//      e[k] = newValue       // e now has a unique copy of the data
//      return e[i]           // use i to access e
//   }
//
// Note that because all accesses to a dictionary storage are bounds-checked,
// this scheme never compromises memory safety.
//
//
// Bridging
// ========
//
// Bridging `NSDictionary` to `Dictionary`
// ---------------------------------------
//
// FIXME(eager-bridging): rewrite this based on modern constraints.
//
// `NSDictionary` bridges to `Dictionary<NSObject, AnyObject>` in `O(1)`,
// without memory allocation.
//
// Bridging `Dictionary` to `NSDictionary`
// ---------------------------------------
//
// `Dictionary<K, V>` bridges to `NSDictionary` in O(1)
// but may incur an allocation depending on the following conditions:
//
// * If the Dictionary is freshly allocated without any elements, then it
//   contains the empty singleton Storage which is returned as a toll-free
//   implementation of `NSDictionary`.
//
// * If both `K` and `V` are bridged verbatim, then `Dictionary<K, V>` is 
//   still toll-free bridged to `NSDictionary` by returning its Storage.
//
// * If the Dictionary is actually a lazily bridged NSDictionary, then that
//   NSDictionary is returned. 
//
// * Otherwise, bridging the `Dictionary` is done by wrapping its buffer in a 
//   `_SwiftDeferredNSDictionary<K, V>`. This incurs an O(1)-sized allocation.
//
//   Complete bridging of the native Storage's elements to another Storage 
//   is performed on first access. This is O(n) work, but is hopefully amortized
//   by future accesses.
//
//   This design ensures that:
//   - Every time keys or values are accessed on the bridged `NSDictionary`,
//     new objects are not created.
//   - Accessing the same element (key or value) multiple times will return
//     the same pointer.
//
// Bridging `NSSet` to `Set` and vice versa
// ----------------------------------------
//
// Bridging guarantees for `Set<Element>` are the same as for
// `Dictionary<Element, ()>`.
//

/// This protocol is only used for compile-time checks that
/// every buffer type implements all required operations.

//===--- APIs unique to Set<Element> --------------------------------------===//

/// An unordered collection of unique elements.
///
/// You use a set instead of an array when you need to test efficiently for
/// membership and you aren't concerned with the order of the elements in the
/// collection, or when you need to ensure that each element appears only once
/// in a collection.
///
/// You can create a set with any element type that conforms to the `Hashable`
/// protocol. By default, most types in the standard library are hashable,
/// including strings, numeric and Boolean types, enumeration cases without
/// associated values, and even sets themselves.
///
/// Swift makes it as easy to create a new set as to create a new array. Simply
/// assign an array literal to a variable or constant with the `Set` type
/// specified.
///
///     let ingredients: Set = ["cocoa beans", "sugar", "cocoa butter", "salt"]
///     if ingredients.contains("sugar") {
///         print("No thanks, too sweet.")
///     }
///     // Prints "No thanks, too sweet."
///
/// Set Operations
/// ==============
///
/// Sets provide a suite of mathematical set operations. For example, you can
/// efficiently test a set for membership of an element or check its
/// intersection with another set:
///
/// - Use the `contains(_:)` method to test whether a set contains a specific
///   element.
/// - Use the "equal to" operator (`==`) to test whether two sets contain the
///   same elements.
/// - Use the `isSubset(of:)` method to test whether a set contains all the
///   elements of another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `isSuperset(of:)` method to test whether all elements of a set
///   are contained in another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `isStrictSubset(of:)` and `isStrictSuperset(of:)` methods to test
///   whether a set is a subset or superset of, but not equal to, another set.
/// - Use the `isDisjoint(with:)` method to test whether a set has any elements
///   in common with another set.
///
/// You can also combine, exclude, or subtract the elements of two sets:
///
/// - Use the `union(_:)` method to create a new set with the elements of a set
///   and another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `intersection(_:)` method to create a new set with only the
///   elements common to a set and another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `symmetricDifference(_:)` method to create a new set with the
///   elements that are in either a set or another set or sequence, but not in
///   both.
/// - Use the `subtracting(_:)` method to create a new set with the elements of
///   a set that are not also in another set or sequence.
///
/// You can modify a set in place by using these methods' mutating
/// counterparts: `formUnion(_:)`, `formIntersection(_:)`,
/// `formSymmetricDifference(_:)`, and `subtract(_:)`.
///
/// Set operations are not limited to use with other sets. Instead, you can
/// perform set operations with another set, an array, or any other sequence
/// type.
///
///     var primes: Set = [2, 3, 5, 7]
///
///     // Tests whether primes is a subset of a Range<Int>
///     print(primes.isSubset(of: 0..<10))
///     // Prints "true"
///
///     // Performs an intersection with an Array<Int>
///     let favoriteNumbers = [5, 7, 15, 21]
///     print(primes.intersection(favoriteNumbers))
///     // Prints "[5, 7]"
///
/// Sequence and Collection Operations
/// ==================================
///
/// In addition to the `Set` type's set operations, you can use any nonmutating
/// sequence or collection methods with a set.
///
///     if primes.isEmpty {
///         print("No primes!")
///     } else {
///         print("We have \(primes.count) primes.")
///     }
///     // Prints "We have 4 primes."
///
///     let primesSum = primes.reduce(0, +)
///     // 'primesSum' == 17
///
///     let primeStrings = primes.sorted().map(String.init)
///     // 'primeStrings' == ["2", "3", "5", "7"]
///
/// You can iterate through a set's unordered elements with a `for`-`in` loop.
///
///     for number in primes {
///         print(number)
///     }
///     // Prints "5"
///     // Prints "7"
///     // Prints "2"
///     // Prints "3"
///
/// Many sequence and collection operations return an array or a type-erasing
/// collection wrapper instead of a set. To restore efficient set operations,
/// create a new set from the result.
///
///     let morePrimes = primes.union([11, 13, 17, 19])
///
///     let laterPrimes = morePrimes.filter { $0 > 10 }
///     // 'laterPrimes' is of type Array<Int>
///
///     let laterPrimesSet = Set(morePrimes.filter { $0 > 10 })
///     // 'laterPrimesSet' is of type Set<Int>
///
/// Bridging Between Set and NSSet
/// ==============================
///
/// You can bridge between `Set` and `NSSet` using the `as` operator. For
/// bridging to be possible, the `Element` type of a set must be a class, an
/// `@objc` protocol (a protocol imported from Objective-C or marked with the
/// `@objc` attribute), or a type that bridges to a Foundation type.
///
/// Bridging from `Set` to `NSSet` always takes O(1) time and space. When the
/// set's `Element` type is neither a class nor an `@objc` protocol, any
/// required bridging of elements occurs at the first access of each element,
/// so the first operation that uses the contents of the set (for example, a
/// membership test) can take O(*n*).
///
/// Bridging from `NSSet` to `Set` first calls the `copy(with:)` method
/// (`- copyWithZone:` in Objective-C) on the set to get an immutable copy and
/// then performs additional Swift bookkeeping work that takes O(1) time. For
/// instances of `NSSet` that are already immutable, `copy(with:)` returns the
/// same set in constant time; otherwise, the copying performance is
/// unspecified. The instances of `NSSet` and `Set` share buffer using the
/// same copy-on-write optimization that is used when two instances of `Set`
/// share buffer.

//===--- APIs unique to Dictionary<Key, Value> ----------------------------===//

/// A collection whose elements are key-value pairs.
///
/// A dictionary is a type of hash table, providing fast access to the entries
/// it contains. Each entry in the table is identified using its key, which is
/// a hashable type such as a string or number. You use that key to retrieve
/// the corresponding value, which can be any object. In other languages,
/// similar data types are known as hashes or associated arrays.
///
/// Create a new dictionary by using a dictionary literal. A dictionary literal
/// is a comma-separated list of key-value pairs, in which a colon separates
/// each key from its associated value, surrounded by square brackets. You can
/// assign a dictionary literal to a variable or constant or pass it to a
/// function that expects a dictionary.
///
/// Here's how you would create a dictionary of HTTP response codes and their
/// related messages:
///
///     var responseMessages = [200: "OK",
///                             403: "Access forbidden",
///                             404: "File not found",
///                             500: "Internal server error"]
///
/// The `responseMessages` variable is inferred to have type `[Int: String]`.
/// The `Key` type of the dictionary is `Int`, and the `Value` type of the
/// dictionary is `String`.
///
/// To create a dictionary with no key-value pairs, use an empty dictionary
/// literal (`[:]`).
///
///     var emptyDict: [String: String] = [:]
///
/// Any type that conforms to the `Hashable` protocol can be used as a
/// dictionary's `Key` type, including all of Swift's basic types. You can use
/// your own custom types as dictionary keys by making them conform to the
/// `Hashable` protocol.
///
/// Getting and Setting Dictionary Values
/// =====================================
///
/// The most common way to access values in a dictionary is to use a key as a
/// subscript. Subscripting with a key takes the following form:
///
///     print(responseMessages[200])
///     // Prints "Optional("OK")"
///
/// Subscripting a dictionary with a key returns an optional value, because a
/// dictionary might not hold a value for the key that you use in the
/// subscript.
///
/// The next example uses key-based subscripting of the `responseMessages`
/// dictionary with two keys that exist in the dictionary and one that does
/// not.
///
///     let httpResponseCodes = [200, 403, 301]
///     for code in httpResponseCodes {
///         if let message = responseMessages[code] {
///             print("Response \(code): \(message)")
///         } else {
///             print("Unknown response \(code)")
///         }
///     }
///     // Prints "Response 200: OK"
///     // Prints "Response 403: Access Forbidden"
///     // Prints "Unknown response 301"
///
/// You can also update, modify, or remove keys and values from a dictionary
/// using the key-based subscript. To add a new key-value pair, assign a value
/// to a key that isn't yet a part of the dictionary.
///
///     responseMessages[301] = "Moved permanently"
///     print(responseMessages[301])
///     // Prints "Optional("Moved permanently")"
///
/// Update an existing value by assigning a new value to a key that already
/// exists in the dictionary. If you assign `nil` to an existing key, the key
/// and its associated value are removed. The following example updates the
/// value for the `404` code to be simply "Not found" and removes the
/// key-value pair for the `500` code entirely.
///
///     responseMessages[404] = "Not found"
///     responseMessages[500] = nil
///     print(responseMessages)
///     // Prints "[301: "Moved permanently", 200: "OK", 403: "Access forbidden", 404: "Not found"]"
///
/// In a mutable `Dictionary` instance, you can modify in place a value that
/// you've accessed through a keyed subscript. The code sample below declares a
/// dictionary called `interestingNumbers` with string keys and values that
/// are integer arrays, then sorts each array in-place in descending order.
///
///     var interestingNumbers = ["primes": [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15],
///                               "triangular": [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28],
///                               "hexagonal": [1, 6, 15, 28, 45, 66, 91]]
///     for key in interestingNumbers.keys {
///         interestingNumbers[key]?.sort(by: >)
///     }
///
///     print(interestingNumbers["primes"]!)
///     // Prints "[15, 13, 11, 7, 5, 3, 2]"
///
/// Iterating Over the Contents of a Dictionary
/// ===========================================
///
/// Every dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. You can
/// iterate over a dictionary using a `for`-`in` loop, decomposing each
/// key-value pair into the elements of a tuple.
///
///     let imagePaths = ["star": "/glyphs/star.png",
///                       "portrait": "/images/content/portrait.jpg",
///                       "spacer": "/images/shared/spacer.gif"]
///
///     for (name, path) in imagePaths {
///         print("The path to '\(name)' is '\(path)'.")
///     }
///     // Prints "The path to 'star' is '/glyphs/star.png'."
///     // Prints "The path to 'portrait' is '/images/content/portrait.jpg'."
///     // Prints "The path to 'spacer' is '/images/shared/spacer.gif'."
///
/// The order of key-value pairs in a dictionary is stable between mutations
/// but is otherwise unpredictable. If you need an ordered collection of
/// key-value pairs and don't need the fast key lookup that `Dictionary`
/// provides, see the `DictionaryLiteral` type for an alternative.
///
/// You can search a dictionary's contents for a particular value using the
/// `contains(where:)` or `index(where:)` methods supplied by default
/// implementation. The following example checks to see if `imagePaths` contains
/// any paths in the `"/glyphs"` directory:
///
///     let glyphIndex = imagePaths.index { $0.value.hasPrefix("/glyphs") }
///     if let index = glyphIndex {
///         print("The '\(imagesPaths[index].key)' image is a glyph.")
///     } else {
///         print("No glyphs found!")
///     }
///     // Prints "The 'star' image is a glyph.")
///
/// Note that in this example, `imagePaths` is subscripted using a dictionary
/// index. Unlike the key-based subscript, the index-based subscript returns
/// the corresponding key-value pair as a non-optional tuple.
///
///     print(imagePaths[glyphIndex!])
///     // Prints "("star", "/glyphs/star.png")"
///
/// A dictionary's indices stay valid across additions to the dictionary as
/// long as the dictionary has enough capacity to store the added values
/// without allocating more buffer. When a dictionary outgrows its buffer,
/// existing indices may be invalidated without any notification.
///
/// When you know how many new values you're adding to a dictionary, use the
/// `init(minimumCapacity:)` initializer to allocate the correct amount of
/// buffer.
///
/// Bridging Between Dictionary and NSDictionary
/// ============================================
///
/// You can bridge between `Dictionary` and `NSDictionary` using the `as`
/// operator. For bridging to be possible, the `Key` and `Value` types of a
/// dictionary must be classes, `@objc` protocols, or types that bridge to
/// Foundation types.
///
/// Bridging from `Dictionary` to `NSDictionary` always takes O(1) time and
/// space. When the dictionary's `Key` and `Value` types are neither classes
/// nor `@objc` protocols, any required bridging of elements occurs at the
/// first access of each element. For this reason, the first operation that
/// uses the contents of the dictionary may take O(*n*).
///
/// Bridging from `NSDictionary` to `Dictionary` first calls the `copy(with:)`
/// method (`- copyWithZone:` in Objective-C) on the dictionary to get an
/// immutable copy and then performs additional Swift bookkeeping work that
/// takes O(1) time. For instances of `NSDictionary` that are already
/// immutable, `copy(with:)` usually returns the same dictionary in O(1) time;
/// otherwise, the copying performance is unspecified. The instances of
/// `NSDictionary` and `Dictionary` share buffer using the same copy-on-write
/// optimization that is used when two instances of `Dictionary` share
/// buffer.
