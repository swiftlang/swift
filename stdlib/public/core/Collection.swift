/// A type that iterates over a collection using its indices.
///
/// The `IndexingIterator` type is the default iterator for any collection that
/// doesn't declare its own. It acts as an iterator by using a collection's
/// indices to step over each value in the collection. Most collections in the
/// standard library use `IndexingIterator` as their iterator.
///
/// By default, any custom collection type you create will inherit a
/// `makeIterator()` method that returns an `IndexingIterator` instance,
/// making it unnecessary to declare your own. When creating a custom
/// collection type, add the minimal requirements of the `Collection`
/// protocol: starting and ending indices and a subscript for accessing
/// elements. With those elements defined, the inherited `makeIterator()`
/// method satisfies the requirements of the `Sequence` protocol.
///
/// Here's an example of a type that declares the minimal requirements for a
/// collection. The `CollectionOfTwo` structure is a fixed-size collection
/// that always holds two elements of a specific type.
///
///     struct CollectionOfTwo<Element>: Collection {
///         let elements: (Element, Element)
///
///         init(_ first: Element, _ second: Element) {
///             self.elements = (first, second)
///         }
///
///         var startIndex: Int { return 0 }
///         var endIndex: Int   { return 2 }
///
///         subscript(index: Int) -> Element {
///             switch index {
///             case 0: return elements.0
///             case 1: return elements.1
///             default: fatalError("Index out of bounds.")
///             }
///         }
///         
///         func index(after i: Int) -> Int {
///             precondition(i < endIndex, "Can't advance beyond endIndex")
///             return i + 1
///         }
///     }
///
/// Because `CollectionOfTwo` doesn't define its own `makeIterator()`
/// method or `Iterator` associated type, it uses the default iterator type,
/// `IndexingIterator`. This example shows how a `CollectionOfTwo` instance
/// can be created holding the values of a point, and then iterated over
/// using a `for`-`in` loop.
///
///     let point = CollectionOfTwo(15.0, 20.0)
///     for element in point {
///         print(element)
///     }
///     // Prints "15.0"
///     // Prints "20.0"

/// A sequence whose elements can be traversed multiple times,

///
/// Collections are used extensively throughout the standard library. When you
/// use arrays, dictionaries, and other collections, you benefit from the
/// operations that the `Collection` protocol declares and implements. In
/// addition to the operations that collections inherit from the `Sequence`
/// protocol, you gain access to methods that depend on accessing an element
/// at a specific position in a collection.
///
/// For example, if you want to print only the first word in a string, you can
/// search for the index of the first space, and then create a substring up to
/// that position.
///
///     let text = "Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo."
///     if let firstSpace = text.firstIndex(of: " ") {
///         print(text[..<firstSpace])
///     }
///     // Prints "Buffalo"
///
/// The `firstSpace` constant is an index into the `text` string---the position
/// of the first space in the string. You can store indices in variables, and
/// pass them to collection algorithms or use them later to access the
/// corresponding element. In the example above, `firstSpace` is used to
/// extract the prefix that contains elements up to that index.
///
/// Accessing Individual Elements
/// =============================
///
/// You can access an element of a collection through its subscript by using
/// any valid index except the collection's `endIndex` property. This property
/// is a "past the end" index that does not correspond with any element of the
/// collection.
///
/// Here's an example of accessing the first character in a string through its
/// subscript:
///
///     let firstChar = text[text.startIndex]
///     print(firstChar)
///     // Prints "B"
///
/// The `Collection` protocol declares and provides default implementations for
/// many operations that depend on elements being accessible by their
/// subscript. For example, you can also access the first character of `text`
/// using the `first` property, which has the value of the first element of
/// the collection, or `nil` if the collection is empty.
///
///     print(text.first)
///     // Prints "Optional("B")"
///
/// You can pass only valid indices to collection operations. You can find a
/// complete set of a collection's valid indices by starting with the
/// collection's `startIndex` property and finding every successor up to, and
/// including, the `endIndex` property. All other values of the `Index` type,
/// such as the `startIndex` property of a different collection, are invalid
/// indices for this collection.
///
/// Saved indices may become invalid as a result of mutating operations. For
/// more information about index invalidation in mutable collections, see the
/// reference for the `MutableCollection` and `RangeReplaceableCollection`
/// protocols, as well as for the specific type you're using.
///
/// Accessing Slices of a Collection
/// ================================
///
/// You can access a slice of a collection through its ranged subscript or by
/// calling methods like `prefix(while:)` or `suffix(_:)`. A slice of a
/// collection can contain zero or more of the original collection's elements
/// and shares the original collection's semantics.
///
/// The following example creates a `firstWord` constant by using the
/// `prefix(while:)` method to get a slice of the `text` string.
///
///     let firstWord = text.prefix(while: { $0 != " " })
///     print(firstWord)
///     // Prints "Buffalo"
///
/// You can retrieve the same slice using the string's ranged subscript, which
/// takes a range expression.
///
///     if let firstSpace = text.firstIndex(of: " ") {
///         print(text[..<firstSpace])
///         // Prints "Buffalo"
///     }
///
/// The retrieved slice of `text` is equivalent in each of these cases.
///
/// Slices Share Indices
/// --------------------
///
/// A collection and its slices share the same indices. An element of a
/// collection is located under the same index in a slice as in the base
/// collection, as long as neither the collection nor the slice has been
/// mutated since the slice was created.
///
/// For example, suppose you have an array holding the number of absences from
/// each class during a session.
///
///     var absences = [0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 0]
///
/// You're tasked with finding the day with the most absences in the second
/// half of the session. To find the index of the day in question, follow
/// these steps:
///
/// 1) Create a slice of the `absences` array that holds the second half of the
///    days.
/// 2) Use the `max(by:)` method to determine the index of the day with the
///    most absences.
/// 3) Print the result using the index found in step 2 on the original
///    `absences` array.
///
/// Here's an implementation of those steps:
///
///     let secondHalf = absences.suffix(absences.count / 2)
///     if let i = secondHalf.indices.max(by: { secondHalf[$0] < secondHalf[$1] }) {
///         print("Highest second-half absences: \(absences[i])")
///     }
///     // Prints "Highest second-half absences: 3"
///
/// Slices Inherit Collection Semantics
/// -----------------------------------
///
/// A slice inherits the value or reference semantics of its base collection.
/// That is, when working with a slice of a mutable collection that has value
/// semantics, such as an array, mutating the original collection triggers a
/// copy of that collection and does not affect the contents of the slice.
///
/// For example, if you update the last element of the `absences` array from
/// `0` to `2`, the `secondHalf` slice is unchanged.
///
///     absences[7] = 2
///     print(absences)
///     // Prints "[0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 2]"
///     print(secondHalf)
///     // Prints "[0, 3, 1, 0]"
///
/// Traversing a Collection
/// =======================
///
/// Although a sequence can be consumed as it is traversed, a collection is
/// guaranteed to be *multipass*: Any element can be repeatedly accessed by
/// saving its index. Moreover, a collection's indices form a finite range of
/// the positions of the collection's elements. The fact that all collections
/// are finite guarantees the safety of many sequence operations, such as
/// using the `contains(_:)` method to test whether a collection includes an
/// element.
///
/// Iterating over the elements of a collection by their positions yields the
/// same elements in the same order as iterating over that collection using
/// its iterator. This example demonstrates that the `characters` view of a
/// string returns the same characters in the same order whether the view's
/// indices or the view itself is being iterated.
///
///     let word = "Swift"
///     for character in word {
///         print(character)
///     }
///     // Prints "S"
///     // Prints "w"
///     // Prints "i"
///     // Prints "f"
///     // Prints "t"
///
///     for i in word.indices {
///         print(word[i])
///     }
///     // Prints "S"
///     // Prints "w"
///     // Prints "i"
///     // Prints "f"
///     // Prints "t"
///
/// Conforming to the Collection Protocol
/// =====================================
///
/// If you create a custom sequence that can provide repeated access to its
/// elements, make sure that its type conforms to the `Collection` protocol in
/// order to give a more useful and more efficient interface for sequence and
/// collection operations. To add `Collection` conformance to your type, you
/// must declare at least the following requirements:
///
/// - The `startIndex` and `endIndex` properties
/// - A subscript that provides at least read-only access to your type's
///   elements
/// - The `index(after:)` method for advancing an index into your collection
///
/// Expected Performance
/// ====================
///
/// Types that conform to `Collection` are expected to provide the `startIndex`
/// and `endIndex` properties and subscript access to elements as O(1)
/// operations. Types that are not able to guarantee this performance must
/// document the departure, because many collection operations depend on O(1)
/// subscripting performance for their own performance guarantees.
///
/// The performance of some collection operations depends on the type of index
/// that the collection provides. For example, a random-access collection,
/// which can measure the distance between two indices in O(1) time, can
/// calculate its `count` property in O(1) time. Conversely, because a forward
/// or bidirectional collection must traverse the entire collection to count
/// the number of contained elements, accessing its `count` property is an
/// O(*n*) operation.
