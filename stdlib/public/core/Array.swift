//  Three generic, mutable array-like types with value semantics.
//
//  - `Array<Element>` is like `ContiguousArray<Element>` when `Element` is not
//    a reference type or an Objective-C existential.  Otherwise, it may use
//    an `NSArray` bridged from Cocoa for storage.
//
//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//

/// An ordered, random-access collection.
///
/// Arrays are one of the most commonly used data types in an app. You use
/// arrays to organize your app's data. Specifically, you use the `Array` type
/// to hold elements of a single type, the array's `Element` type. An array
/// can store any kind of elements---from integers to strings to classes.
///
/// Swift makes it easy to create arrays in your code using an array literal:
/// simply surround a comma-separated list of values with square brackets.
/// Without any other information, Swift creates an array that includes the
/// specified values, automatically inferring the array's `Element` type. For
/// example:
///
///     // An array of 'Int' elements
///     let oddNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
///
///     // An array of 'String' elements
///     let streets = ["Albemarle", "Brandywine", "Chesapeake"]
///
/// You can create an empty array by specifying the `Element` type of your
/// array in the declaration. For example:
///
///     // Shortened forms are preferred
///     var emptyDoubles: [Double] = []
///
///     // The full type name is also allowed
///     var emptyFloats: Array<Float> = Array()
///
/// If you need an array that is preinitialized with a fixed number of default
/// values, use the `Array(repeating:count:)` initializer.
///
///     var digitCounts = Array(repeating: 0, count: 10)
///     print(digitCounts)
///     // Prints "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
///
/// Accessing Array Values
/// ======================
///
/// When you need to perform an operation on all of an array's elements, use a
/// `for`-`in` loop to iterate through the array's contents.
///
///     for street in streets {
///         print("I don't live on \(street).")
///     }
///     // Prints "I don't live on Albemarle."
///     // Prints "I don't live on Brandywine."
///     // Prints "I don't live on Chesapeake."
///
/// Use the `isEmpty` property to check quickly whether an array has any
/// elements, or use the `count` property to find the number of elements in
/// the array.
///
///     if oddNumbers.isEmpty {
///         print("I don't know any odd numbers.")
///     } else {
///         print("I know \(oddNumbers.count) odd numbers.")
///     }
///     // Prints "I know 8 odd numbers."
///
/// Use the `first` and `last` properties for safe access to the value of the
/// array's first and last elements. If the array is empty, these properties
/// are `nil`.
///
///     if let firstElement = oddNumbers.first, let lastElement = oddNumbers.last {
///         print(firstElement, lastElement, separator: ", ")
///     }
///     // Prints "1, 15"
///
///     print(emptyDoubles.first, emptyDoubles.last, separator: ", ")
///     // Prints "nil, nil"
///
/// You can access individual array elements through a subscript. The first
/// element of a nonempty array is always at index zero. You can subscript an
/// array with any integer from zero up to, but not including, the count of
/// the array. Using a negative number or an index equal to or greater than
/// `count` triggers a runtime error. For example:
///
///     print(oddNumbers[0], oddNumbers[3], separator: ", ")
///     // Prints "1, 7"
///
///     print(emptyDoubles[0])
///     // Triggers runtime error: Index out of range
///
/// Adding and Removing Elements
/// ============================
///
/// Suppose you need to store a list of the names of students that are signed
/// up for a class you're teaching. During the registration period, you need
/// to add and remove names as students add and drop the class.
///
///     var students = ["Ben", "Ivy", "Jordell"]
///
/// To add single elements to the end of an array, use the `append(_:)` method.
/// Add multiple elements at the same time by passing another array or a
/// sequence of any kind to the `append(contentsOf:)` method.
///
///     students.append("Maxime")
///     students.append(contentsOf: ["Shakia", "William"])
///     // ["Ben", "Ivy", "Jordell", "Maxime", "Shakia", "William"]
///
/// You can add new elements in the middle of an array by using the
/// `insert(_:at:)` method for single elements and by using
/// `insert(contentsOf:at:)` to insert multiple elements from another
/// collection or array literal. The elements at that index and later indices
/// are shifted back to make room.
///
///     students.insert("Liam", at: 3)
///     // ["Ben", "Ivy", "Jordell", "Liam", "Maxime", "Shakia", "William"]
///
/// To remove elements from an array, use the `remove(at:)`,
/// `removeSubrange(_:)`, and `removeLast()` methods.
///
///     // Ben's family is moving to another state
///     students.remove(at: 0)
///     // ["Ivy", "Jordell", "Liam", "Maxime", "Shakia", "William"]
///
///     // William is signing up for a different class
///     students.removeLast()
///     // ["Ivy", "Jordell", "Liam", "Maxime", "Shakia"]
///
/// You can replace an existing element with a new value by assigning the new
/// value to the subscript.
///
///     if let i = students.firstIndex(of: "Maxime") {
///         students[i] = "Max"
///     }
///     // ["Ivy", "Jordell", "Liam", "Max", "Shakia"]
///
/// Growing the Size of an Array
/// ----------------------------
///
/// Every array reserves a specific amount of memory to hold its contents. When
/// you add elements to an array and that array begins to exceed its reserved
/// capacity, the array allocates a larger region of memory and copies its
/// elements into the new storage. The new storage is a multiple of the old
/// storage's size. This exponential growth strategy means that appending an
/// element happens in constant time, averaging the performance of many append
/// operations. Append operations that trigger reallocation have a performance
/// cost, but they occur less and less often as the array grows larger.
///
/// If you know approximately how many elements you will need to store, use the
/// `reserveCapacity(_:)` method before appending to the array to avoid
/// intermediate reallocations. Use the `capacity` and `count` properties to
/// determine how many more elements the array can store without allocating
/// larger storage.
///
/// For arrays of most `Element` types, this storage is a contiguous block of
/// memory. For arrays with an `Element` type that is a class or `@objc`
/// protocol type, this storage can be a contiguous block of memory or an
/// instance of `NSArray`. Because any arbitrary subclass of `NSArray` can
/// become an `Array`, there are no guarantees about representation or
/// efficiency in this case.
///
/// Modifying Copies of Arrays
/// ==========================
///
/// Each array has an independent value that includes the values of all of its
/// elements. For simple types such as integers and other structures, this
/// means that when you change a value in one array, the value of that element
/// does not change in any copies of the array. For example:
///
///     var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
///     var numbersCopy = numbers
///     numbers[0] = 100
///     print(numbers)
///     // Prints "[100, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
///     print(numbersCopy)
///     // Prints "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
///
/// If the elements in an array are instances of a class, the semantics are the
/// same, though they might appear different at first. In this case, the
/// values stored in the array are references to objects that live outside the
/// array. If you change a reference to an object in one array, only that
/// array has a reference to the new object. However, if two arrays contain
/// references to the same object, you can observe changes to that object's
/// properties from both arrays. For example:
///
///     // An integer type with reference semantics
///     class IntegerReference {
///         var value = 10
///     }
///     var firstIntegers = [IntegerReference(), IntegerReference()]
///     var secondIntegers = firstIntegers
///
///     // Modifications to an instance are visible from either array
///     firstIntegers[0].value = 100
///     print(secondIntegers[0].value)
///     // Prints "100"
///
///     // Replacements, additions, and removals are still visible
///     // only in the modified array
///     firstIntegers[0] = IntegerReference()
///     print(firstIntegers[0].value)
///     // Prints "10"
///     print(secondIntegers[0].value)
///     // Prints "100"
///
/// Arrays, like all variable-size collections in the standard library, use
/// copy-on-write optimization. Multiple copies of an array share the same
/// storage until you modify one of the copies. When that happens, the array
/// being modified replaces its storage with a uniquely owned copy of itself,
/// which is then modified in place. Optimizations are sometimes applied that
/// can reduce the amount of copying.
///
/// This means that if an array is sharing storage with other copies, the first
/// mutating operation on that array incurs the cost of copying the array. An
/// array that is the sole owner of its storage can perform mutating
/// operations in place.
///
/// In the example below, a `numbers` array is created along with two copies
/// that share the same storage. When the original `numbers` array is
/// modified, it makes a unique copy of its storage before making the
/// modification. Further modifications to `numbers` are made in place, while
/// the two copies continue to share the original storage.
///
///     var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
///     var firstCopy = numbers
///     var secondCopy = numbers
///
///     // The storage for 'numbers' is copied here
///     numbers[0] = 100
///     numbers[1] = 200
///     numbers[2] = 300
///     // 'numbers' is [100, 200, 300, 4, 5]
///     // 'firstCopy' and 'secondCopy' are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
///
/// Bridging Between Array and NSArray
/// ==================================
///
/// When you need to access APIs that require data in an `NSArray` instance
/// instead of `Array`, use the type-cast operator (`as`) to bridge your
/// instance. For bridging to be possible, the `Element` type of your array
/// must be a class, an `@objc` protocol (a protocol imported from Objective-C
/// or marked with the `@objc` attribute), or a type that bridges to a
/// Foundation type.
///
/// The following example shows how you can bridge an `Array` instance to
/// `NSArray` to use the `write(to:atomically:)` method. In this example, the
/// `colors` array can be bridged to `NSArray` because the `colors` array's
/// `String` elements bridge to `NSString`. The compiler prevents bridging the
/// `moreColors` array, on the other hand, because its `Element` type is
/// `Optional<String>`, which does *not* bridge to a Foundation type.
///
///     let colors = ["periwinkle", "rose", "moss"]
///     let moreColors: [String?] = ["ochre", "pine"]
///
///     let url = URL(fileURLWithPath: "names.plist")
///     (colors as NSArray).write(to: url, atomically: true)
///     // true
///
///     (moreColors as NSArray).write(to: url, atomically: true)
///     // error: cannot convert value of type '[String?]' to type 'NSArray'
///
/// Bridging from `Array` to `NSArray` takes O(1) time and O(1) space if the
/// array's elements are already instances of a class or an `@objc` protocol;
/// otherwise, it takes O(*n*) time and space.
///
/// When the destination array's element type is a class or an `@objc`
/// protocol, bridging from `NSArray` to `Array` first calls the `copy(with:)`
/// (`- copyWithZone:` in Objective-C) method on the array to get an immutable
/// copy and then performs additional Swift bookkeeping work that takes O(1)
/// time. For instances of `NSArray` that are already immutable, `copy(with:)`
/// usually returns the same array in O(1) time; otherwise, the copying
/// performance is unspecified. If `copy(with:)` returns the same array, the
/// instances of `NSArray` and `Array` share storage using the same
/// copy-on-write optimization that is used when two instances of `Array`
/// share storage.
///
/// When the destination array's element type is a nonclass type that bridges
/// to a Foundation type, bridging from `NSArray` to `Array` performs a
/// bridging copy of the elements to contiguous storage in O(*n*) time. For
/// example, bridging from `NSArray` to `Array<Int>` performs such a copy. No
/// further bridging is required when accessing elements of the `Array`
/// instance.
///
/// - Note: The `ContiguousArray` and `ArraySlice` types are not bridged;
///   instances of those types always have a contiguous block of memory as
///   their storage.
