//  Three generic, mutable array-like types with value semantics.
//
//  - `ContiguousArray<Element>` is a fast, contiguous array of `Element` with
//    a known backing store.
//
//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//

/// A contiguously stored array.
///
/// The `ContiguousArray` type is a specialized array that always stores its
/// elements in a contiguous region of memory. This contrasts with `Array`,
/// which can store its elements in either a contiguous region of memory or an
/// `NSArray` instance if its `Element` type is a class or `@objc` protocol.
///
/// If your array's `Element` type is a class or `@objc` protocol and you do
/// not need to bridge the array to `NSArray` or pass the array to Objective-C
/// APIs, using `ContiguousArray` may be more efficient and have more
/// predictable performance than `Array`. If the array's `Element` type is a
/// struct or enumeration, `Array` and `ContiguousArray` should have similar
/// efficiency.
///
/// For more information about using arrays, see `Array` and `ArraySlice`, with
/// which `ContiguousArray` shares most properties and methods.

  /// `append(contentsOf:)` methods take care of this detail for you, but
  /// `reserveCapacity(_:)` allocates only as much space as you tell it to
  /// (padded to a round value), and no more. This avoids over-allocation, but
  /// can result in insertion not having amortized constant-time performance.
  ///
  /// The following code declares `values`, an array of integers, and the
  /// `addTenQuadratic()` function, which adds ten more values to the `values`
  /// array on each call.
  ///
  ///       var values: [Int] = [0, 1, 2, 3]
