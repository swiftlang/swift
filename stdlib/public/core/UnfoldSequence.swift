/// Returns a sequence formed from `first` and repeated lazy applications of
/// `next`.
///
/// The first element in the sequence is always `first`, and each successive
/// element is the result of invoking `next` with the previous element. The
/// sequence ends when `next` returns `nil`. If `next` never returns `nil`, the
/// sequence is infinite.
///
/// This function can be used to replace many cases that were previously handled
/// using C-style `for` loops.
///
/// Example:
///
///     // Walk the elements of a tree from a node up to the root
///     for node in sequence(first: leaf, next: { $0.parent }) {
///       // node is leaf, then leaf.parent, then leaf.parent.parent, etc.
///     }
///
///     // Iterate over all powers of two (ignoring overflow)
///     for value in sequence(first: 1, next: { $0 * 2 }) {
///       // value is 1, then 2, then 4, then 8, etc.
///     }
///
/// - Parameter first: The first element to be returned from the sequence.
/// - Parameter next: A closure that accepts the previous sequence element and
///   returns the next element.
/// - Returns: A sequence that starts with `first` and continues with every
///   value returned by passing the previous element to `next`.

/// infinite.
///
/// This function can be used to replace many instances of `AnyIterator` that
/// wrap a closure.

/// Example:
///
///     // Interleave two sequences that yield the same element type
///     sequence(state: (false, seq1.makeIterator(), seq2.makeIterator()), next: { iters in
///       iters.0 = !iters.0

/// - Parameter state: The initial state that will be passed to the closure.
/// - Parameter next: A closure that accepts an `inout` state and returns the
///   next element of the sequence.
