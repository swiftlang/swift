// A Collection protocol with replaceSubrange.
//
//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//

/// A collection that supports replacement of an arbitrary subrange of elements
/// with the elements of another collection.
///
/// Range-replaceable collections provide operations that insert and remove
/// elements. For example, you can add elements to an array of strings by
/// calling any of the inserting or appending operations that the
/// `RangeReplaceableCollection` protocol defines.
///
///     var bugs = ["Aphid", "Damselfly"]
///     bugs.append("Earwig")
///     bugs.insert(contentsOf: ["Bumblebee", "Cicada"], at: 1)
///     print(bugs)
///     // Prints "["Aphid", "Bumblebee", "Cicada", "Damselfly", "Earwig"]"
///
/// Likewise, `RangeReplaceableCollection` types can remove one or more
/// elements using a single operation.
///
///     bugs.removeLast()
///     bugs.removeSubrange(1...2)
///     print(bugs)
///     // Prints "["Aphid", "Damselfly"]"
///
///     bugs.removeAll()
///     print(bugs)
///     // Prints "[]"
///
/// Lastly, use the eponymous `replaceSubrange(_:with:)` method to replace
/// a subrange of elements with the contents of another collection. Here,
/// three elements in the middle of an array of integers are replaced by the
/// five elements of a `Repeated<Int>` instance.
///
///      var nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
///      nums.replaceSubrange(1...3, with: repeatElement(1, count: 5))
///      print(nums)
///      // Prints "[10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 50]"
///
/// Conforming to the RangeReplaceableCollection Protocol
/// =====================================================
///
/// To add `RangeReplaceableCollection` conformance to your custom collection,
/// add an empty initializer and the `replaceSubrange(_:with:)` method to your
/// custom type. `RangeReplaceableCollection` provides default implementations
/// of all its other methods using this initializer and method. For example,
/// the `removeSubrange(_:)` method is implemented by calling
/// `replaceSubrange(_:with:)` with an empty collection for the `newElements`
/// parameter. You can override any of the protocol's required methods to
/// provide your own custom implementation.

  /// removed.
  ///
  /// In this example, three elements in the middle of an array of integers are
  /// replaced by the five elements of a `Repeated<Int>` instance.

  /// If you pass a zero-length range as the `subrange` parameter, this method
  /// inserts the elements of `newElements` at `subrange.startIndex`. Calling
  /// the `insert(contentsOf:at:)` method instead is preferred.
