  /// You can use the `relative(to:)` method to convert a range expression,
  /// which could be missing one or both of its endpoints, into a concrete
  /// range that is bounded on both sides. The following example uses this
  /// method to convert a partial range up to `4` into a half-open range,
  /// using an array instance to add the range's lower bound.
  ///
  ///     let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
  ///     let upToFour = ..<4
  ///
  ///     let r1 = upToFour.relative(to: numbers)
  ///     // r1 == 0..<4
  ///
  /// The `r1` range is bounded on the lower end by `0` because that is the
  /// starting index of the `numbers` array. When the collection passed to
  /// `relative(to:)` starts with a different index, that index is used as the
  /// lower bound instead. The next example creates a slice of `numbers`
  /// starting at index `2`, and then uses the slice with `relative(to:)` to
  /// convert `upToFour` to a concrete range.
