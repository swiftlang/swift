  /// You can use the `relative(to:)` method to convert a range expression,

  /// method to convert a partial range up to `4` into a half-open range,
  /// using an array instance to add the range's lower bound.
  ///
  ///     let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
  ///     let upToFour = ..<4

  ///     let r1 = upToFour.relative(to: numbers)

  ///
  /// The `r1` range is bounded on the lower end by `0` because that is the
  /// starting index of the `numbers` array. When the collection passed to
  /// `relative(to:)` starts with a different index, that index is used as the
  /// lower bound instead. The next example creates a slice of `numbers`
  /// starting at index `2`, and then uses the slice with `relative(to:)` to
  /// convert `upToFour` to a concrete range.

/// Because a `PartialRangeFrom` sequence counts upward indefinitely, do not
/// use one with methods that read the entire sequence before returning, such
/// as `map(_:)`, `filter(_:)`, or `suffix(_:)`. It is safe to use operations
/// that put an upper limit on the number of elements they access, such as
/// `prefix(_:)` or `dropFirst(_:)`, and operations that you can guarantee
/// will terminate, such as passing a closure you know will eventually return
/// `true` to `first(where:)`.
///
/// In the following example, the `asciiTable` sequence is made by zipping
/// together the characters in the `alphabet` string with a partial range
/// starting at 65, the ASCII value of the capital letter A. Iterating over
/// two zipped sequences continues only as long as the shorter of the two
/// sequences, so the iteration stops at the end of `alphabet`.
