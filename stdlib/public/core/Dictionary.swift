// Implementation notes
// ====================
//
// `Dictionary` uses two storage schemes: native storage and Cocoa storage.
//
// Native storage is a hash table with open addressing and linear probing. The
// bucket array forms a logical ring (e.g., a chain can wrap around the end of
// buckets array to the beginning of it).
//
// The logical bucket array is implemented as three arrays: Key, Value, and a
// bitmap that marks valid entries. An unoccupied entry marks the end of a
// chain.  There is always at least one unoccupied entry among the
// buckets. `Dictionary` does not use tombstones.
//
// In addition to the native storage, `Dictionary` can also wrap an
// `NSDictionary` in order to allow bridging `NSDictionary` to `Dictionary` in
// `O(1)`.
//
// Native dictionary storage uses a data structure like this::
//
//   struct Dictionary<K,V>
//   +------------------------------------------------+
//   | enum Dictionary<K,V>._Variant                  |
//   | +--------------------------------------------+ |
//   | | [struct _NativeDictionary<K,V>             | |
//   | +---|----------------------------------------+ |
//   +----/-------------------------------------------+
//       /
//      |
//      V
//   class _RawDictionaryStorage
//   +-----------------------------------------------------------+
//   | <isa>                                                     |
//   | <refcount>                                                |
//   | _count                                                    |
//   | _capacity                                                 |
//   | _scale                                                    |
//   | _age                                                      |
//   | _seed                                                     |
//   | _rawKeys                                                  |
//   | _rawValue                                                 |
//   | [inline bitset of occupied entries]                       |
//   | [inline array of keys]                                    |
//   | [inline array of values]                                  |
//   +-----------------------------------------------------------+
//
// Cocoa storage uses a data structure like this:
//
//   struct Dictionary<K,V>
//   +----------------------------------------------+
//   | enum Dictionary<K,V>._Variant                |
//   | +----------------------------------------+   |
//   | | [ struct _CocoaDictionary              |   |
//   | +---|------------------------------------+   |
//   +----/-----------------------------------------+
//       /
//      |
//      V
//   class NSDictionary
//   +--------------+
//   | [refcount#1] |
//   | etc.         |
//   +--------------+
//     ^
//     |
//      \  struct _CocoaDictionary.Index
//   +--|------------------------------------+
//   |  * base: _CocoaDictionary             |
//   |  allKeys: array of all keys           |
//   |  currentKeyIndex: index into allKeys  |
//   +---------------------------------------+
//
//
// The Native Kinds of Storage
// ---------------------------
//
// The native backing store is represented by three different classes:
// * `_RawDictionaryStorage`
// * `_EmptyDictionarySingleton` (extends Raw)
// * `_DictionaryStorage<K: Hashable, V>` (extends Raw)
//
// (Hereafter `Raw`, `Empty`, and `Storage`, respectively)
//
// In a less optimized implementation, `Raw` and `Empty` could be eliminated, as
// they exist only to provide special-case behaviors.
//
// `Empty` is the a type-punned empty singleton storage. Its single instance is
// created by the runtime during process startup. Because we use the same
// instance for all empty dictionaries, it cannot declare type parameters.
//
// `Storage` provides backing storage for regular native dictionaries. All
// non-empty native dictionaries use an instance of `Storage` to store their
// elements. `Storage` is a generic class with a nontrivial deinit.
//
// `Raw` is the base class for both `Empty` and `Storage`. It defines a full set
// of ivars to access dictionary contents. Like `Empty`, `Raw` is also
// non-generic; the base addresses it stores are represented by untyped raw
// pointers. The only reason `Raw` exists is to allow `_NativeDictionary` to
// treat `Empty` and `Storage` in a unified way.
//
// Storage classes don't contain much logic; `Raw` in particular is just a
// collection of ivars. `Storage` provides allocation/deinitialization logic,
// while `Empty`/`Storage` implement NSDictionary methods. All other operations
// are actually implemented by the `_NativeDictionary` and `_HashTable` structs.
//
// The `_HashTable` struct provides low-level hash table metadata operations.
// (Lookups, iteration, insertion, removal.) It owns and maintains the
// tail-allocated bitmap.
//
// `_NativeDictionary` implements the actual Dictionary operations.  It
// consists of a reference to a `Raw` instance, to allow for the possibility of
// the empty singleton.
//
//
// Index Invalidation
// ------------------
//
// FIXME: decide if this guarantee is worth making, as it restricts
// collision resolution to first-come-first-serve. The most obvious alternative
// would be robin hood hashing. The Rust code base is the best
// resource on a *practical* implementation of robin hood hashing I know of:
// https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/ac919fcd9d4a958baf99b2f2ed5c3d38a2ebf9d0/src/libstd/collections/hash/map.rs#L70-L178
//
// Indexing a container, `c[i]`, uses the integral offset stored in the index
// to access the elements referenced by the container. Generally, an index into
// one container has no meaning for another. However copy-on-write currently
// preserves indices under insertion, as long as reallocation doesn't occur:
//
//   var (i, found) = d.find(k) // i is associated with d's storage
//   if found {
//      var e = d            // now d is sharing its data with e
//      e[newKey] = newValue // e now has a unique copy of the data
//      return e[i]          // use i to access e
//   }
//
// The result should be a set of iterator invalidation rules familiar to anyone
// familiar with the C++ standard library.  Note that because all accesses to a
// dictionary storage are bounds-checked, this scheme never compromises memory
// safety.
//
// As a safeguard against using invalid indices, Set and Dictionary maintain a
// mutation counter in their storage header (`_age`). This counter gets bumped
// every time an element is removed and whenever the contents are
// rehashed. Native indices include a copy of this counter so that index
// validation can verify it matches with current storage. This can't catch all
// misuse, because counters may match by accident; but it does make indexing a
// lot more reliable.
//
// Bridging
// ========
//
// Bridging `NSDictionary` to `Dictionary`
// ---------------------------------------
//
// FIXME(eager-bridging): rewrite this based on modern constraints.
//
// `NSDictionary` bridges to `Dictionary<NSObject, AnyObject>` in `O(1)`,
// without memory allocation.
//
// Bridging to `Dictionary<AnyHashable, AnyObject>` takes `O(n)` time, as the
// keys need to be fully rehashed after conversion to `AnyHashable`.
//
// Bridging `NSDictionary` to `Dictionary<Key, Value>` is O(1) if both Key and
// Value are bridged verbatim.
//
// Bridging `Dictionary` to `NSDictionary`
// ---------------------------------------
//
// `Dictionary<K, V>` bridges to `NSDictionary` in O(1)
// but may incur an allocation depending on the following conditions:
//
// * If the Dictionary is freshly allocated without any elements, then it
//   contains the empty singleton Storage which is returned as a toll-free
//   implementation of `NSDictionary`.
//
// * If both `K` and `V` are bridged verbatim, then `Dictionary<K, V>` is
//   still toll-free bridged to `NSDictionary` by returning its Storage.
//
// * If the Dictionary is actually a lazily bridged NSDictionary, then that
//   NSDictionary is returned.
//
// * Otherwise, bridging the `Dictionary` is done by wrapping it in a
//   `_SwiftDeferredNSDictionary<K, V>`. This incurs an O(1)-sized allocation.
//
//   Complete bridging of the native Storage's elements to another Storage
//   is performed on first access. This is O(n) work, but is hopefully amortized
//   by future accesses.
//
//   This design ensures that:
//   - Every time keys or values are accessed on the bridged `NSDictionary`,
//     new objects are not created.
//   - Accessing the same element (key or value) multiple times will return
//     the same pointer.
//
// Bridging `NSSet` to `Set` and vice versa
// ----------------------------------------
//
// Bridging guarantees for `Set<Element>` are the same as for
// `Dictionary<Element, NSObject>`.
//

/// A collection whose elements are key-value pairs.
///
/// A dictionary is a type of hash table, providing fast access to the entries
/// it contains. Each entry in the table is identified using its key, which is
/// a hashable type such as a string or number. You use that key to retrieve
/// the corresponding value, which can be any object. In other languages,
/// similar data types are known as hashes or associated arrays.
///
/// Create a new dictionary by using a dictionary literal. A dictionary literal
/// is a comma-separated list of key-value pairs, in which a colon separates
/// each key from its associated value, surrounded by square brackets. You can
/// assign a dictionary literal to a variable or constant or pass it to a
/// function that expects a dictionary.
///
/// Here's how you would create a dictionary of HTTP response codes and their
/// related messages:
///
///     var responseMessages = [200: "OK",
///                             403: "Access forbidden",
///                             404: "File not found",
///                             500: "Internal server error"]
///
/// The `responseMessages` variable is inferred to have type `[Int: String]`.
/// The `Key` type of the dictionary is `Int`, and the `Value` type of the
/// dictionary is `String`.
///
/// To create a dictionary with no key-value pairs, use an empty dictionary
/// literal (`[:]`).
///
///     var emptyDict: [String: String] = [:]
///
/// Any type that conforms to the `Hashable` protocol can be used as a
/// dictionary's `Key` type, including all of Swift's basic types. You can use
/// your own custom types as dictionary keys by making them conform to the
/// `Hashable` protocol.
///
/// Getting and Setting Dictionary Values
/// =====================================
///
/// The most common way to access values in a dictionary is to use a key as a
/// subscript. Subscripting with a key takes the following form:
///
///     print(responseMessages[200])
///     // Prints "Optional("OK")"
///
/// Subscripting a dictionary with a key returns an optional value, because a
/// dictionary might not hold a value for the key that you use in the
/// subscript.
///
/// The next example uses key-based subscripting of the `responseMessages`
/// dictionary with two keys that exist in the dictionary and one that does
/// not.
///
///     let httpResponseCodes = [200, 403, 301]
///     for code in httpResponseCodes {
///         if let message = responseMessages[code] {
///             print("Response \(code): \(message)")
///         } else {
///             print("Unknown response \(code)")
///         }
///     }
///     // Prints "Response 200: OK"
///     // Prints "Response 403: Access Forbidden"
///     // Prints "Unknown response 301"
///
/// You can also update, modify, or remove keys and values from a dictionary
/// using the key-based subscript. To add a new key-value pair, assign a value
/// to a key that isn't yet a part of the dictionary.
///
///     responseMessages[301] = "Moved permanently"
///     print(responseMessages[301])
///     // Prints "Optional("Moved permanently")"
///
/// Update an existing value by assigning a new value to a key that already
/// exists in the dictionary. If you assign `nil` to an existing key, the key
/// and its associated value are removed. The following example updates the
/// value for the `404` code to be simply "Not found" and removes the
/// key-value pair for the `500` code entirely.
///
///     responseMessages[404] = "Not found"
///     responseMessages[500] = nil
///     print(responseMessages)
///     // Prints "[301: "Moved permanently", 200: "OK", 403: "Access forbidden", 404: "Not found"]"
///
/// In a mutable `Dictionary` instance, you can modify in place a value that
/// you've accessed through a keyed subscript. The code sample below declares a
/// dictionary called `interestingNumbers` with string keys and values that
/// are integer arrays, then sorts each array in-place in descending order.
///
///     var interestingNumbers = ["primes": [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17],
///                               "triangular": [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28],
///                               "hexagonal": [1, 6, 15, 28, 45, 66, 91]]
///     for key in interestingNumbers.keys {
///         interestingNumbers[key]?.sort(by: >)
///     }
///
///     print(interestingNumbers["primes"]!)
///     // Prints "[17, 13, 11, 7, 5, 3, 2]"
///
/// Iterating Over the Contents of a Dictionary
/// ===========================================
///
/// Every dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. You can
/// iterate over a dictionary using a `for`-`in` loop, decomposing each
/// key-value pair into the elements of a tuple.
///
///     let imagePaths = ["star": "/glyphs/star.png",
///                       "portrait": "/images/content/portrait.jpg",
///                       "spacer": "/images/shared/spacer.gif"]
///
///     for (name, path) in imagePaths {
///         print("The path to '\(name)' is '\(path)'.")
///     }
///     // Prints "The path to 'star' is '/glyphs/star.png'."
///     // Prints "The path to 'portrait' is '/images/content/portrait.jpg'."
///     // Prints "The path to 'spacer' is '/images/shared/spacer.gif'."
///
/// The order of key-value pairs in a dictionary is stable between mutations
/// but is otherwise unpredictable. If you need an ordered collection of
/// key-value pairs and don't need the fast key lookup that `Dictionary`
/// provides, see the `KeyValuePairs` type for an alternative.
///
/// You can search a dictionary's contents for a particular value using the
/// `contains(where:)` or `firstIndex(where:)` methods supplied by default
/// implementation. The following example checks to see if `imagePaths` contains
/// any paths in the `"/glyphs"` directory:
///
///     let glyphIndex = imagePaths.firstIndex(where: { $0.value.hasPrefix("/glyphs") })
///     if let index = glyphIndex {
///         print("The '\(imagesPaths[index].key)' image is a glyph.")
///     } else {
///         print("No glyphs found!")
///     }
///     // Prints "The 'star' image is a glyph.")
///
/// Note that in this example, `imagePaths` is subscripted using a dictionary
/// index. Unlike the key-based subscript, the index-based subscript returns
/// the corresponding key-value pair as a non-optional tuple.
///
///     print(imagePaths[glyphIndex!])
///     // Prints "("star", "/glyphs/star.png")"
///
/// A dictionary's indices stay valid across additions to the dictionary as
/// long as the dictionary has enough capacity to store the added values
/// without allocating more buffer. When a dictionary outgrows its buffer,
/// existing indices may be invalidated without any notification.
///
/// When you know how many new values you're adding to a dictionary, use the
/// `init(minimumCapacity:)` initializer to allocate the correct amount of
/// buffer.
///
/// Bridging Between Dictionary and NSDictionary
/// ============================================
///
/// You can bridge between `Dictionary` and `NSDictionary` using the `as`
/// operator. For bridging to be possible, the `Key` and `Value` types of a
/// dictionary must be classes, `@objc` protocols, or types that bridge to
/// Foundation types.
///
/// Bridging from `Dictionary` to `NSDictionary` always takes O(1) time and
/// space. When the dictionary's `Key` and `Value` types are neither classes
/// nor `@objc` protocols, any required bridging of elements occurs at the
/// first access of each element. For this reason, the first operation that
/// uses the contents of the dictionary may take O(*n*).
///
/// Bridging from `NSDictionary` to `Dictionary` first calls the `copy(with:)`
/// method (`- copyWithZone:` in Objective-C) on the dictionary to get an
/// immutable copy and then performs additional Swift bookkeeping work that
/// takes O(1) time. For instances of `NSDictionary` that are already
/// immutable, `copy(with:)` usually returns the same dictionary in O(1) time;
/// otherwise, the copying performance is unspecified. The instances of
/// `NSDictionary` and `Dictionary` share buffer using the same copy-on-write
/// optimization that is used when two instances of `Dictionary` share
/// buffer.
