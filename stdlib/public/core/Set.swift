/// An unordered collection of unique elements.
///
/// You use a set instead of an array when you need to test efficiently for
/// membership and you aren't concerned with the order of the elements in the
/// collection, or when you need to ensure that each element appears only once
/// in a collection.
///
/// You can create a set with any element type that conforms to the `Hashable`
/// protocol. By default, most types in the standard library are hashable,
/// including strings, numeric and Boolean types, enumeration cases without
/// associated values, and even sets themselves.
///
/// Swift makes it as easy to create a new set as to create a new array. Simply
/// assign an array literal to a variable or constant with the `Set` type
/// specified.
///
///     let ingredients: Set = ["cocoa beans", "sugar", "cocoa butter", "salt"]
///     if ingredients.contains("sugar") {
///         print("No thanks, too sweet.")
///     }
///     // Prints "No thanks, too sweet."
///
/// Set Operations
/// ==============
///
/// Sets provide a suite of mathematical set operations. For example, you can
/// efficiently test a set for membership of an element or check its
/// intersection with another set:
///
/// - Use the `contains(_:)` method to test whether a set contains a specific
///   element.
/// - Use the "equal to" operator (`==`) to test whether two sets contain the
///   same elements.
/// - Use the `isSubset(of:)` method to test whether a set contains all the
///   elements of another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `isSuperset(of:)` method to test whether all elements of a set
///   are contained in another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `isStrictSubset(of:)` and `isStrictSuperset(of:)` methods to test
///   whether a set is a subset or superset of, but not equal to, another set.
/// - Use the `isDisjoint(with:)` method to test whether a set has any elements
///   in common with another set.
///
/// You can also combine, exclude, or subtract the elements of two sets:
///
/// - Use the `union(_:)` method to create a new set with the elements of a set
///   and another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `intersection(_:)` method to create a new set with only the
///   elements common to a set and another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `symmetricDifference(_:)` method to create a new set with the
///   elements that are in either a set or another set or sequence, but not in
///   both.
/// - Use the `subtracting(_:)` method to create a new set with the elements of
///   a set that are not also in another set or sequence.
///
/// You can modify a set in place by using these methods' mutating
/// counterparts: `formUnion(_:)`, `formIntersection(_:)`,
/// `formSymmetricDifference(_:)`, and `subtract(_:)`.
///
/// Set operations are not limited to use with other sets. Instead, you can
/// perform set operations with another set, an array, or any other sequence
/// type.
///
///     var primes: Set = [2, 3, 5, 7]
///
///     // Tests whether primes is a subset of a Range<Int>
///     print(primes.isSubset(of: 0..<10))
///     // Prints "true"
///
///     // Performs an intersection with an Array<Int>
///     let favoriteNumbers = [5, 7, 15, 21]
///     print(primes.intersection(favoriteNumbers))
///     // Prints "[5, 7]"
///
/// Sequence and Collection Operations
/// ==================================
///
/// In addition to the `Set` type's set operations, you can use any nonmutating
/// sequence or collection methods with a set.
///
///     if primes.isEmpty {
///         print("No primes!")
///     } else {
///         print("We have \(primes.count) primes.")
///     }
///     // Prints "We have 4 primes."
///
///     let primesSum = primes.reduce(0, +)
///     // 'primesSum' == 17
///
///     let primeStrings = primes.sorted().map(String.init)
///     // 'primeStrings' == ["2", "3", "5", "7"]
///
/// You can iterate through a set's unordered elements with a `for`-`in` loop.
///
///     for number in primes {
///         print(number)
///     }
///     // Prints "5"
///     // Prints "7"
///     // Prints "2"
///     // Prints "3"
///
/// Many sequence and collection operations return an array or a type-erasing
/// collection wrapper instead of a set. To restore efficient set operations,
/// create a new set from the result.
///
///     let morePrimes = primes.union([11, 13, 17, 19])
///
///     let laterPrimes = morePrimes.filter { $0 > 10 }
///     // 'laterPrimes' is of type Array<Int>
///
///     let laterPrimesSet = Set(morePrimes.filter { $0 > 10 })
///     // 'laterPrimesSet' is of type Set<Int>
///
/// Bridging Between Set and NSSet
/// ==============================
///
/// You can bridge between `Set` and `NSSet` using the `as` operator. For
/// bridging to be possible, the `Element` type of a set must be a class, an
/// `@objc` protocol (a protocol imported from Objective-C or marked with the
/// `@objc` attribute), or a type that bridges to a Foundation type.
///
/// Bridging from `Set` to `NSSet` always takes O(1) time and space. When the
/// set's `Element` type is neither a class nor an `@objc` protocol, any
/// required bridging of elements occurs at the first access of each element,
/// so the first operation that uses the contents of the set (for example, a
/// membership test) can take O(*n*).
///
/// Bridging from `NSSet` to `Set` first calls the `copy(with:)` method
/// (`- copyWithZone:` in Objective-C) on the set to get an immutable copy and
/// then performs additional Swift bookkeeping work that takes O(1) time. For
/// instances of `NSSet` that are already immutable, `copy(with:)` returns the
/// same set in constant time; otherwise, the copying performance is
/// unspecified. The instances of `NSSet` and `Set` share buffer using the
/// same copy-on-write optimization that is used when two instances of `Set`
/// share buffer.
