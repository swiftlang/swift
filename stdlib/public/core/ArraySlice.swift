//  - `ArraySlice<Element>` presents an arbitrary subsequence of some
//    contiguous sequence of `Element`s.
//
//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//

/// A slice of an `Array`, `ContiguousArray`, or `ArraySlice` instance.
///
/// The `ArraySlice` type makes it fast and efficient for you to perform
/// operations on sections of a larger array. Instead of copying over the
/// elements of a slice to new storage, an `ArraySlice` instance presents a
/// view onto the storage of a larger array. And because `ArraySlice`
/// presents the same interface as `Array`, you can generally perform the
/// same operations on a slice as you could on the original array.
///
/// For more information about using arrays, see `Array` and `ContiguousArray`,
/// with which `ArraySlice` shares most properties and methods.
///
/// Slices Are Views onto Arrays
/// ============================
///
/// For example, suppose you have an array holding the number of absences
/// from each class during a session.
///
///     let absences = [0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 0]
///
/// You want to compare the absences in the first half of the session with
/// those in the second half. To do so, start by creating two slices of the
/// `absences` array.
///
///     let midpoint = absences.count / 2
///
///     let firstHalf = absences[..<midpoint]
///     let secondHalf = absences[midpoint...]
///
/// Neither the `firstHalf` nor `secondHalf` slices allocate any new storage
/// of their own. Instead, each presents a view onto the storage of the
/// `absences` array.
///
/// You can call any method on the slices that you might have called on the
/// `absences` array. To learn which half had more absences, use the
/// `reduce(_:_:)` method to calculate each sum.
///
///     let firstHalfSum = firstHalf.reduce(0, +)
///     let secondHalfSum = secondHalf.reduce(0, +)
///
///     if firstHalfSum > secondHalfSum {
///         print("More absences in the first half.")
///     } else {
///         print("More absences in the second half.")
///     }
///     // Prints "More absences in the first half."
///
/// - Important: Long-term storage of `ArraySlice` instances is discouraged. A
///   slice holds a reference to the entire storage of a larger array, not
///   just to the portion it presents, even after the original array's lifetime
///   ends. Long-term storage of a slice may therefore prolong the lifetime of
///   elements that are no longer otherwise accessible, which can appear to be
///   memory and object leakage.
///
/// Slices Maintain Indices
/// =======================
///
/// Unlike `Array` and `ContiguousArray`, the starting index for an
/// `ArraySlice` instance isn't always zero. Slices maintain the same
/// indices of the larger array for the same elements, so the starting
/// index of a slice depends on how it was created, letting you perform
/// index-based operations on either a full array or a slice.
///
/// Sharing indices between collections and their subsequences is an important
/// part of the design of Swift's collection algorithms. Suppose you are
/// tasked with finding the first two days with absences in the session. To
/// find the indices of the two days in question, follow these steps:
///
/// 1) Call `firstIndex(where:)` to find the index of the first element in the
///    `absences` array that is greater than zero.
/// 2) Create a slice of the `absences` array starting after the index found in
///    step 1.
/// 3) Call `firstIndex(where:)` again, this time on the slice created in step
///    2. Where in some languages you might pass a starting index into an
///    `indexOf` method to find the second day, in Swift you perform the same
///    operation on a slice of the original array.
/// 4) Print the results using the indices found in steps 1 and 3 on the
///    original `absences` array.
///
/// Here's an implementation of those steps:
///
///     if let i = absences.firstIndex(where: { $0 > 0 }) {                 // 1
///         let absencesAfterFirst = absences[(i + 1)...]                   // 2
///         if let j = absencesAfterFirst.firstIndex(where: { $0 > 0 }) {   // 3
///             print("The first day with absences had \(absences[i]).")    // 4
///             print("The second day with absences had \(absences[j]).")
///         }
///     }
///     // Prints "The first day with absences had 2."
///     // Prints "The second day with absences had 4."
///
/// In particular, note that `j`, the index of the second day with absences,
/// was found in a slice of the original array and then used to access a value
/// in the original `absences` array itself.
///
/// - Note: To safely reference the starting and ending indices of a slice,
///   always use the `startIndex` and `endIndex` properties instead of
///   specific values.

  /// allocation pattern for appending elements to achieve amortized

  /// `append(contentsOf:)` methods take care of this detail for you, but
  /// `reserveCapacity(_:)` allocates only as much space as you tell it to
  /// (padded to a round value), and no more. This avoids over-allocation, but
  /// can result in insertion not having amortized constant-time performance.
  ///
  /// The following code declares `values`, an array of integers, and the
  /// `addTenQuadratic()` function, which adds ten more values to the `values`
  /// array on each call.

  ///           values.reserveCapacity(newCount)
