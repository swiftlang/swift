/// A floating-point numeric type.
///
/// Floating-point types are used to represent fractional numbers, like 5.5,
/// 100.0, or 3.14159274. Each floating-point type has its own possible range
/// and precision. The floating-point types in the standard library are
/// `Float`, `Double`, and `Float80` where available.
///
/// Create new instances of floating-point types using integer or
/// floating-point literals. For example:
///
///     let temperature = 33.2
///     let recordHigh = 37.5
///
/// The `FloatingPoint` protocol declares common arithmetic operations, so you
/// can write functions and algorithms that work on any floating-point type.
/// The following example declares a function that calculates the length of
/// the hypotenuse of a right triangle given its two perpendicular sides.
/// Because the `hypotenuse(_:_:)` function uses a generic parameter
/// constrained to the `FloatingPoint` protocol, you can call it using any
/// floating-point type.
///
///     func hypotenuse<T: FloatingPoint>(_ a: T, _ b: T) -> T {
///         return (a * a + b * b).squareRoot()
///     }
///
///     let (dx, dy) = (3.0, 4.0)
///     let distance = hypotenuse(dx, dy)
///     // distance == 5.0
///
/// Floating-point values are represented as a *sign* and a *magnitude*, where
/// the magnitude is calculated using the type's *radix* and the instance's
/// *significand* and *exponent*. This magnitude calculation takes the
/// following form for a floating-point value `x` of type `F`, where `**` is
/// exponentiation:
///
///     x.significand * F.radix ** x.exponent
///
/// Here's an example of the number -8.5 represented as an instance of the
/// `Double` type, which defines a radix of 2.
///
///     let y = -8.5
///     // y.sign == .minus
///     // y.significand == 1.0625
///     // y.exponent == 3
///
///     let magnitude = 1.0625 * Double(2 ** 3)
///     // magnitude == 8.5
///
/// Types that conform to the `FloatingPoint` protocol provide most basic
/// (clause 5) operations of the [IEEE 754 specification][spec]. The base,
/// precision, and exponent range are not fixed in any way by this protocol,
/// but it enforces the basic requirements of any IEEE 754 floating-point
/// type.
///
/// [spec]: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4610933
///
/// Additional Considerations
/// =========================
///
/// In addition to representing specific numbers, floating-point types also
/// have special values for working with overflow and nonnumeric results of
/// calculation.
///
/// Infinity
/// --------
///
/// Any value whose magnitude is so great that it would round to a value
/// outside the range of representable numbers is rounded to *infinity*. For a
/// type `F`, positive and negative infinity are represented as `F.infinity`
/// and `-F.infinity`, respectively. Positive infinity compares greater than
/// every finite value and negative infinity, while negative infinity compares
/// less than every finite value and positive infinity. Infinite values with
/// the same sign are equal to each other.
///
///     let values: [Double] = [10.0, 25.0, -10.0, .infinity, -.infinity]
///     print(values.sorted())
///     // Prints "[-inf, -10.0, 10.0, 25.0, inf]"
///
/// Operations with infinite values follow real arithmetic as much as possible:
/// Adding or subtracting a finite value, or multiplying or dividing infinity
/// by a nonzero finite value, results in infinity.
///
/// NaN ("not a number")
/// --------------------
///
/// Floating-point types represent values that are neither finite numbers nor
/// infinity as NaN, an abbreviation for "not a number." Comparing a NaN with
/// any value, including another NaN, results in `false`.
///
///     let myNaN = Double.nan
///     print(myNaN > 0)
///     // Prints "false"
///     print(myNaN < 0)
///     // Prints "false"
///     print(myNaN == .nan)
///     // Prints "false"
///
/// Because testing whether one NaN is equal to another NaN results in `false`,
/// use the `isNaN` property to test whether a value is NaN.
///
///     print(myNaN.isNaN)
///     // Prints "true"
///
/// NaN propagates through many arithmetic operations. When you are operating
/// on many values, this behavior is valuable because operations on NaN simply
/// forward the value and don't cause runtime errors. The following example
/// shows how NaN values operate in different contexts.
///
/// Imagine you have a set of temperature data for which you need to report
/// some general statistics: the total number of observations, the number of
/// valid observations, and the average temperature. First, a set of
/// observations in Celsius is parsed from strings to `Double` values:
///
///     let temperatureData = ["21.5", "19.25", "27", "no data", "28.25", "no data", "23"]
///     let tempsCelsius = temperatureData.map { Double($0) ?? .nan }
///     // tempsCelsius == [21.5, 19.25, 27, nan, 28.25, nan, 23.0]
///
/// Note that some elements in the `temperatureData ` array are not valid
/// numbers. When these invalid strings are parsed by the `Double` failable
/// initializer, the example uses the nil-coalescing operator (`??`) to
/// provide NaN as a fallback value.
///
/// Next, the observations in Celsius are converted to Fahrenheit:
///
///     let tempsFahrenheit = tempsCelsius.map { $0 * 1.8 + 32 }
///     // tempsFahrenheit == [70.7, 66.65, 80.6, nan, 82.85, nan, 73.4]
///
/// The NaN values in the `tempsCelsius` array are propagated through the
/// conversion and remain NaN in `tempsFahrenheit`.
///
/// Because calculating the average of the observations involves combining
/// every value of the `tempsFahrenheit` array, any NaN values cause the
/// result to also be NaN, as seen in this example:
///
///     let badAverage = tempsFahrenheit.reduce(0.0, combine: +) / Double(tempsFahrenheit.count)
///     // badAverage.isNaN == true
///
/// Instead, when you need an operation to have a specific numeric result,
/// filter out any NaN values using the `isNaN` property.
///
///     let validTemps = tempsFahrenheit.filter { !$0.isNaN }
///     let average = validTemps.reduce(0.0, combine: +) / Double(validTemps.count)
///
/// Finally, report the average temperature and observation counts:
///
///     print("Average: \(average)°F in \(validTemps.count) " +
///           "out of \(tempsFahrenheit.count) observations.")
///     // Prints "Average: 74.84°F in 5 out of 7 observations."
