/// A type that presents a mathematical set interface to a bit set.
///
/// You use the `OptionSet` protocol to represent bitset types, where
/// individual bits represent members of a set. Adopting this protocol in
/// your custom types lets you perform set-related operations such as
/// membership tests, unions, and intersections on those types. What's more,
/// when implemented using specific criteria, adoption of this protocol
/// requires no extra work on your part.
///
/// When creating an option set, include a `rawValue` property in your type
/// declaration. For your type to automatically receive default implementations
/// for set-related operations, the `rawValue` property must be of a type that
/// conforms to the `FixedWidthInteger` protocol, such as `Int` or `UInt8`.
/// Next, create unique options as static properties of your custom type using
/// unique powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and so forth) for each individual
/// property's raw value so that each property can be represented by a single
/// bit of the type's raw value.
///
/// For example, consider a custom type called `ShippingOptions` that is an
/// option set of the possible ways to ship a customer's purchase.
/// `ShippingOptions` includes a `rawValue` property of type `Int` that stores
/// the bit mask of available shipping options. The static members `nextDay`,
/// `secondDay`, `priority`, and `standard` are unique, individual options.
///
///     struct ShippingOptions: OptionSet {
///         let rawValue: Int
///
///         static let nextDay    = ShippingOptions(rawValue: 1 << 0)
///         static let secondDay  = ShippingOptions(rawValue: 1 << 1)
///         static let priority   = ShippingOptions(rawValue: 1 << 2)
///         static let standard   = ShippingOptions(rawValue: 1 << 3)
///
///         static let express: ShippingOptions = [.nextDay, .secondDay]
///         static let all: ShippingOptions = [.express, .priority, .standard]
///     }
///
/// Declare additional preconfigured option set values as static properties
/// initialized with an array literal containing other option values. In the
/// example, because the `express` static property is assigned an array
/// literal with the `nextDay` and `secondDay` options, it will contain those
/// two elements.
///
/// Using an Option Set Type
/// ========================
///
/// When you need to create an instance of an option set, assign one of the
/// type's static members to your variable or constant. Alternatively, to
/// create an option set instance with multiple members, assign an array
/// literal with multiple static members of the option set. To create an empty
/// instance, assign an empty array literal to your variable.
///
///     let singleOption: ShippingOptions = .priority
///     let multipleOptions: ShippingOptions = [.nextDay, .secondDay, .priority]
///     let noOptions: ShippingOptions = []
///
/// Use set-related operations to check for membership and to add or remove
/// members from an instance of your custom option set type. The following
/// example shows how you can determine free shipping options based on a
/// customer's purchase price:
///
///     let purchasePrice = 87.55
///
///     var freeOptions: ShippingOptions = []
///     if purchasePrice > 50 {
///         freeOptions.insert(.priority)
///     }
///
///     if freeOptions.contains(.priority) {
///         print("You've earned free priority shipping!")
///     } else {
///         print("Add more to your cart for free priority shipping!")
///     }
///     // Prints "You've earned free priority shipping!"
