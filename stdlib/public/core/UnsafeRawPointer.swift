/// A raw pointer for accessing untyped data.
///
/// The `UnsafeRawPointer` type provides no automated memory management, no type
/// safety, and no alignment guarantees. You are responsible for handling the
/// life cycle of any memory you work with through unsafe pointers, to avoid
/// leaks or undefined behavior.
///
/// Memory that you manually manage can be either *untyped* or *bound* to a
/// specific type. You use the `UnsafeRawPointer` type to access and
/// manage raw bytes in memory, whether or not that memory has been bound to a
/// specific type.
///
/// Understanding a Pointer's Memory State
/// ======================================
///
/// The memory referenced by an `UnsafeRawPointer` instance can be in one of
/// several states. Many pointer operations must only be applied to pointers
/// with memory in a specific state---you must keep track of the state of the
/// memory you are working with and understand the changes to that state that
/// different operations perform. Memory can be untyped and uninitialized, bound
/// to a type and uninitialized, or bound to a type and initialized to a value.
/// Finally, memory that was allocated previously may have been deallocated,
/// leaving existing pointers referencing unallocated memory.
///
/// Raw, Uninitialized Memory
/// -------------------------
///
/// Raw memory that has just been allocated is in an *uninitialized, untyped*
/// state. Uninitialized memory must be initialized with values of a type
/// before it can be used with any typed operations.
///
/// To bind uninitialized memory to a type without initializing it, use the
/// `bindMemory(to:count:)` method. This method returns a typed pointer
/// for further typed access to the memory.
///
/// Typed Memory
/// ------------
///
/// Memory that has been bound to a type, whether it is initialized or
/// uninitialized, is typically accessed using typed pointers---instances of
/// `UnsafePointer` and `UnsafeMutablePointer`. Initialization, assignment,
/// and deinitialization can be performed using `UnsafeMutablePointer`
/// methods.
///
/// Memory that has been bound to a type can be rebound to a different type
/// only after it has been deinitialized or if the bound type is a *trivial
/// type*. Deinitializing typed memory does not unbind that memory's type. The
/// deinitialized memory can be reinitialized with values of the same type,
/// bound to a new type, or deallocated.
///
/// - Note: A trivial type can be copied bit for bit with no indirection or
///   reference-counting operations. Generally, native Swift types that do not
///   contain strong or weak references or other forms of indirection are
///   trivial, as are imported C structs and enumerations.
///
/// When reading from  memory as raw
/// bytes when that memory is bound to a type, you must ensure that you
/// satisfy any alignment requirements.
///
/// Raw Pointer Arithmetic
/// ======================
///
/// Pointer arithmetic with raw pointers is performed at the byte level. When
/// you add to or subtract from a raw pointer, the result is a new raw pointer
/// offset by that number of bytes. The following example allocates four bytes
/// of memory and stores `0xFF` in all four bytes:
///
///     let bytesPointer = UnsafeMutableRawPointer.allocate(byteCount: 4, alignment: 4)
///     bytesPointer.storeBytes(of: 0xFFFF_FFFF, as: UInt32.self)
///
///     // Load a value from the memory referenced by 'bytesPointer'
///     let x = bytesPointer.load(as: UInt8.self)       // 255
///
///     // Load a value from the last two allocated bytes
///     let offsetPointer = bytesPointer + 2
///     let y = offsetPointer.load(as: UInt16.self)     // 65535
///
/// The code above stores the value `0xFFFF_FFFF` into the four newly allocated
/// bytes, and then loads the first byte as a `UInt8` instance and the third
/// and fourth bytes as a `UInt16` instance.
///
/// Always remember to deallocate any memory that you allocate yourself.
///
///     bytesPointer.deallocate()
///
/// Implicit Casting and Bridging
/// =============================
///
/// When calling a function or method with an `UnsafeRawPointer` parameter, you
/// can pass an instance of that specific pointer type, pass an instance of a
/// compatible pointer type, or use Swift's implicit bridging to pass a
/// compatible pointer.
///
/// For example, the `print(address:as:)` function in the following code sample
/// takes an `UnsafeRawPointer` instance as its first parameter:
///
///     func print<T>(address p: UnsafeRawPointer, as type: T.Type) {
///         let value = p.load(as: type)
///         print(value)
///     }
///
/// As is typical in Swift, you can call the `print(address:as:)` function with
/// an `UnsafeRawPointer` instance. This example passes `rawPointer` as the
/// initial parameter.
///
///     // 'rawPointer' points to memory initialized with `Int` values.
///     let rawPointer: UnsafeRawPointer = ...
///     print(address: rawPointer, as: Int.self)
///     // Prints "42"
///
/// Because typed pointers can be implicitly cast to raw pointers when passed
/// as a parameter, you can also call `print(address:as:)` with any mutable or
/// immutable typed pointer instance.
///
///     let intPointer: UnsafePointer<Int> = ...
///     print(address: intPointer, as: Int.self)
///     // Prints "42"
///
///     let mutableIntPointer = UnsafeMutablePointer(mutating: intPointer)
///     print(address: mutableIntPointer, as: Int.self)
///     // Prints "42"
///
/// Alternatively, you can use Swift's *implicit bridging* to pass a pointer to
/// an instance or to the elements of an array. Use inout syntax to implicitly
/// create a pointer to an instance of any type. The following example uses
/// implicit bridging to pass a pointer to `value` when calling
/// `print(address:as:)`:
///
///     var value: Int = 23
///     print(address: &value, as: Int.self)
///     // Prints "23"
///
/// An immutable pointer to the elements of an array is implicitly created when
/// you pass the array as an argument. This example uses implicit bridging to
/// pass a pointer to the elements of `numbers` when calling
/// `print(address:as:)`.
///
///     let numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]
///     print(address: numbers, as: Int.self)
///     // Prints "5"
///
/// You can also use inout syntax to pass a mutable pointer to the elements of
/// an array. Because `print(address:as:)` requires an immutable pointer,
/// although this is syntactically valid, it isn't necessary.
///
///     var mutableNumbers = numbers
///     print(address: &mutableNumbers, as: Int.self)
///
/// - Important: The pointer created through implicit bridging of an instance
///   or of an array's elements is only valid during the execution of the
///   called function. Escaping the pointer to use after the execution of the
///   function is undefined behavior. In particular, do not use implicit
///   bridging when calling an `UnsafeRawPointer` initializer.
///
///       var number = 5
///       let numberPointer = UnsafeRawPointer(&number)
///       // Accessing 'numberPointer' is undefined behavior.

/// no type safety, and no alignment guarantees. You are responsible for
/// handling the life cycle of any memory you work with through unsafe pointers,
/// to avoid leaks or undefined behavior.
///
/// Memory that you manually manage can be either *untyped* or *bound* to a
/// specific type. You use the `UnsafeMutableRawPointer` type to access and
/// manage raw bytes in memory, whether or not that memory has been bound to a
/// specific type.
///
/// Understanding a Pointer's Memory State
/// ======================================
///
/// The memory referenced by an `UnsafeMutableRawPointer` instance can be in one
/// of several states. Many pointer operations must only be applied to pointers
/// with memory in a specific state---you must keep track of the state of the
/// memory you are working with and understand the changes to that state that
/// different operations perform. Memory can be untyped and uninitialized, bound
/// to a type and uninitialized, or bound to a type and initialized to a value.
/// Finally, memory that was allocated previously may have been deallocated,
/// leaving existing pointers referencing unallocated memory.
///
/// Raw, Uninitialized Memory
/// -------------------------
///
/// Raw memory that has just been allocated is in an *uninitialized, untyped*
/// state. Uninitialized memory must be initialized with values of a type
/// before it can be used with any typed operations.
///
/// You can use methods like `initializeMemory(as:from:)` and
/// `moveInitializeMemory(as:from:count:)` to bind raw memory to a type and
/// initialize it with a value or series of values. To bind uninitialized
/// memory to a type without initializing it, use the `bindMemory(to:count:)`
/// method. These methods all return typed pointers for further typed access
/// to the memory.
///
/// Typed Memory
/// ------------
///
/// Memory that has been bound to a type, whether it is initialized or
/// uninitialized, is typically accessed using typed pointers---instances of
/// `UnsafePointer` and `UnsafeMutablePointer`. Initialization, assignment,
/// and deinitialization can be performed using `UnsafeMutablePointer`
/// methods.
///
/// Memory that has been bound to a type can be rebound to a different type
/// only after it has been deinitialized or if the bound type is a *trivial
/// type*. Deinitializing typed memory does not unbind that memory's type. The
/// deinitialized memory can be reinitialized with values of the same type,
/// bound to a new type, or deallocated.
///
/// - Note: A trivial type can be copied bit for bit with no indirection or
///   reference-counting operations. Generally, native Swift types that do not
///   contain strong or weak references or other forms of indirection are
///   trivial, as are imported C structs and enumerations.
///
/// When reading from or writing to  memory as raw
/// bytes when that memory is bound to a type, you must ensure that you
/// satisfy any alignment requirements.
/// Writing to typed memory as raw bytes must only be performed when the bound
/// type is a trivial type.
///
/// Raw Pointer Arithmetic
/// ======================
///
/// Pointer arithmetic with raw pointers is performed at the byte level. When
/// you add to or subtract from a raw pointer, the result is a new raw pointer
/// offset by that number of bytes. The following example allocates four bytes
/// of memory and stores `0xFF` in all four bytes:
///
///     let bytesPointer = UnsafeMutableRawPointer.allocate(byteCount: 4, alignment: 1)
///     bytesPointer.storeBytes(of: 0xFFFF_FFFF, as: UInt32.self)
///
///     // Load a value from the memory referenced by 'bytesPointer'
///     let x = bytesPointer.load(as: UInt8.self)       // 255
///
///     // Load a value from the last two allocated bytes
///     let offsetPointer = bytesPointer + 2
///     let y = offsetPointer.load(as: UInt16.self)     // 65535
///
/// The code above stores the value `0xFFFF_FFFF` into the four newly allocated
/// bytes, and then loads the first byte as a `UInt8` instance and the third
/// and fourth bytes as a `UInt16` instance.
///
/// Always remember to deallocate any memory that you allocate yourself.
///
///     bytesPointer.deallocate()
///
/// Implicit Casting and Bridging
/// =============================
///
/// When calling a function or method with an `UnsafeMutableRawPointer`
/// parameter, you can pass an instance of that specific pointer type, pass an
/// instance of a compatible pointer type, or use Swift's implicit bridging to
/// pass a compatible pointer.
///
/// For example, the `print(address:as:)` function in the following code sample
/// takes an `UnsafeMutableRawPointer` instance as its first parameter:
///
///     func print<T>(address p: UnsafeMutableRawPointer, as type: T.Type) {
///         let value = p.load(as: type)
///         print(value)
///     }
///
/// As is typical in Swift, you can call the `print(address:as:)` function with
/// an `UnsafeMutableRawPointer` instance. This example passes `rawPointer` as
/// the initial parameter.
///
///     // 'rawPointer' points to memory initialized with `Int` values.
///     let rawPointer: UnsafeMutableRawPointer = ...
///     print(address: rawPointer, as: Int.self)
///     // Prints "42"
///
/// Because typed pointers can be implicitly cast to raw pointers when passed
/// as a parameter, you can also call `print(address:as:)` with any mutable
/// typed pointer instance.
///
///     let intPointer: UnsafeMutablePointer<Int> = ...
///     print(address: intPointer, as: Int.self)
///     // Prints "42"
///
/// Alternatively, you can use Swift's *implicit bridging* to pass a pointer to
/// an instance or to the elements of an array. Use inout syntax to implicitly
/// create a pointer to an instance of any type. The following example uses
/// implicit bridging to pass a pointer to `value` when calling
/// `print(address:as:)`:
///
///     var value: Int = 23
///     print(address: &value, as: Int.self)
///     // Prints "23"
///
/// A mutable pointer to the elements of an array is implicitly created when
/// you pass the array using inout syntax. This example uses implicit bridging
/// to pass a pointer to the elements of `numbers` when calling
/// `print(address:as:)`.
///
///     var numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]
///     print(address: &numbers, as: Int.self)
///     // Prints "5"
///
/// - Important: The pointer created through implicit bridging of an instance
///   or of an array's elements is only valid during the execution of the
///   called function. Escaping the pointer to use after the execution of the
///   function is undefined behavior. In particular, do not use implicit
///   bridging when calling an `UnsafeMutableRawPointer` initializer.
///
///       var number = 5
///       let numberPointer = UnsafeMutableRawPointer(&number)
///       // Accessing 'numberPointer' is undefined behavior.
