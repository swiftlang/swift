/// The memory layout of a type, describing its size, stride, and alignment.
///
/// You can use `MemoryLayout` as a source of information about a type when
/// allocating or binding memory using raw pointers. The following example
/// declares a `Point` type with `x` and `y` coordinates and a Boolean
/// `isFilled` property.
///
///     struct Point {
///         let x: Double
///         let y: Double
///         let isFilled: Bool
///     }
///
/// The size, stride, and alignment of the `Point` type are accessible as
/// static properties of `MemoryLayout<Point>`.
///
///     // MemoryLayout<Point>.size == 17
///     // MemoryLayout<Point>.stride == 24
///     // MemoryLayout<Point>.alignment == 8
///
/// Always use a multiple of a type's `stride` instead of its `size` when
/// allocating memory or accounting for the distance between instances in
/// memory. This example allocates uninitialized raw memory with space
/// for four instances of `Point`.
///
///     let count = 4
///     let pointPointer = UnsafeMutableRawPointer.allocate(
///             byteCount: count * MemoryLayout<Point>.stride,
///             alignment: MemoryLayout<Point>.alignment)

  /// instance properties are always stored out-of-line, their positions are
  /// not accessible using `offset(of:)`.

  /// For example, in the `ProductCategory` type defined here, only

  ///
