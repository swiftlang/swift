/// A type that provides mathematical set operations.
///
/// You use types that conform to the `SetAlgebra` protocol when you need
/// efficient membership tests or mathematical set operations such as
/// intersection, union, and subtraction. In the standard library, you can
/// use the `Set` type with elements of any hashable type, or you can easily
/// create bit masks with `SetAlgebra` conformance using the `OptionSet`
/// protocol. See those types for more information.
///
/// - Note: Unlike ordinary set types, the `Element` type of an `OptionSet` is
///   identical to the `OptionSet` type itself. The `SetAlgebra` protocol is
///   specifically designed to accommodate both kinds of set.
///
/// Conforming to the SetAlgebra Protocol
/// =====================================
///
/// When implementing a custom type that conforms to the `SetAlgebra` protocol,
/// you must implement the required initializers and methods. For the
/// inherited methods to work properly, conforming types must meet the
/// following axioms. Assume that `S` is a custom type that conforms to the
/// `SetAlgebra` protocol, `x` and `y` are instances of `S`, and `e` is of
/// type `S.Element`---the type that the set holds.
///
/// - `S() == []`
/// - `x.intersection(x) == x`
/// - `x.intersection([]) == []`
/// - `x.union(x) == x`
/// - `x.union([]) == x`
/// - `x.contains(e)` implies `x.union(y).contains(e)`
/// - `x.union(y).contains(e)` implies `x.contains(e) || y.contains(e)`
/// - `x.contains(e) && y.contains(e)` if and only if
///   `x.intersection(y).contains(e)`
/// - `x.isSubset(of: y)` if and only if `y.isSuperset(of: x)`
/// - `x.isStrictSuperset(of: y)` if and only if
///   `x.isSuperset(of: y) && x != y`
/// - `x.isStrictSubset(of: y)` if and only if `x.isSubset(of: y) && x != y`
/// 
/// - SeeAlso: `OptionSet`, `Set`
