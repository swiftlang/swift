/// A Unicode string value that is a collection of characters.

/// A string is a series of characters, such as `"Swift"`, that forms a
/// collection. Strings in Swift are Unicode correct and locale insensitive,
/// and are designed to be efficient. The `String` type bridges with the
/// Objective-C class `NSString` and offers interoperability with C functions
/// that works with strings.
///
/// You can create new strings using string literals or string interpolations.
/// A *string literal* is a series of characters enclosed in quotes.
///
///     let greeting = "Welcome!"
///
/// *String interpolations* are string literals that evaluate any included
/// expressions and convert the results to string form. String interpolations
/// give you an easy way to build a string from multiple pieces. Wrap each
/// expression in a string interpolation in parentheses, prefixed by a
/// backslash.
///
///     let name = "Rosa"
///     let personalizedGreeting = "Welcome, \(name)!"
///     // personalizedGreeting == "Welcome, Rosa!"
///
///     let price = 2
///     let number = 3
///     let cookiePrice = "\(number) cookies: $\(price * number)."
///     // cookiePrice == "3 cookies: $6."
///
/// Combine strings using the concatenation operator (`+`).
///
///     let longerGreeting = greeting + " We're glad you're here!"
///     // longerGreeting == "Welcome! We're glad you're here!"
///
/// Multiline string literals are enclosed in three double quotation marks
/// (`"""`), with each delimiter on its own line. Indentation is stripped from

/// Modifying and Comparing Strings
/// ===============================
///
/// Strings always have value semantics. Modifying a copy of a string leaves
/// the original unaffected.
///
///     var otherGreeting = greeting
///     otherGreeting += " Have a nice time!"
///     // otherGreeting == "Welcome! Have a nice time!"
///
///     print(greeting)
///     // Prints "Welcome!"
///
/// Comparing strings for equality using the equal-to operator (`==`) or a
/// relational operator (like `<` or `>=`) is always performed using Unicode
/// canonical representation. As a result, different representations of a
/// string compare as being equal.
///
///     let cafe1 = "Cafe\u{301}"
///     let cafe2 = "Café"
///     print(cafe1 == cafe2)
///     // Prints "true"
///
/// The Unicode scalar value `"\u{301}"` modifies the preceding character to
/// include an accent, so `"e\u{301}"` has the same canonical representation
/// as the single Unicode scalar value `"é"`.
///
/// Basic string operations are not sensitive to locale settings, ensuring that
/// string comparisons and other operations always have a single, stable
/// result, allowing strings to be used as keys in `Dictionary` instances and
/// for other purposes.
///
/// Accessing String Elements
/// =========================
///
/// A string is a collection of *extended grapheme clusters*, which approximate
/// human-readable characters. Many individual characters, such as "é", "김",
/// and "🇮🇳", can be made up of multiple Unicode scalar values. These scalar
/// values are combined by Unicode's boundary algorithms into extended
/// grapheme clusters, represented by the Swift `Character` type. Each element
/// of a string is represented by a `Character` instance.
///
/// For example, to retrieve the first word of a longer string, you can search
/// for a space and then create a substring from a prefix of the string up to
/// that point:
///
///     let name = "Marie Curie"
///     let firstSpace = name.firstIndex(of: " ") ?? name.endIndex
///     let firstName = name[..<firstSpace]
///     // firstName == "Marie"
///
/// The `firstName` constant is an instance of the `Substring` type---a type
/// that represents substrings of a string while sharing the original string's
/// storage. Substrings present the same interface as strings.
///
///     print("\(name)'s first name has \(firstName.count) letters.")
///     // Prints "Marie Curie's first name has 5 letters."
///
/// Accessing a String's Unicode Representation
/// ===========================================
///
/// If you need to access the contents of a string as encoded in different
/// Unicode encodings, use one of the string's `unicodeScalars`, `utf16`, or
/// `utf8` properties. Each property provides access to a view of the string
/// as a series of code units, each encoded in a different Unicode encoding.
///
/// To demonstrate the different views available for every string, the
/// following examples use this `String` instance:
///
///     let cafe = "Cafe\u{301} du 🌍"
///     print(cafe)
///     // Prints "Café du 🌍"
///
/// The `cafe` string is a collection of the nine characters that are visible
/// when the string is displayed.
///
///     print(cafe.count)
///     // Prints "9"
///     print(Array(cafe))
///     // Prints "["C", "a", "f", "é", " ", "d", "u", " ", "🌍"]"
///
/// Unicode Scalar View
/// -------------------
///
/// A string's `unicodeScalars` property is a collection of Unicode scalar
/// values, the 21-bit codes that are the basic unit of Unicode. Each scalar
/// value is represented by a `Unicode.Scalar` instance and is equivalent to a
/// UTF-32 code unit.
///
///     print(cafe.unicodeScalars.count)
///     // Prints "10"
///     print(Array(cafe.unicodeScalars))
///     // Prints "["C", "a", "f", "e", "\u{0301}", " ", "d", "u", " ", "\u{0001F30D}"]"
///     print(cafe.unicodeScalars.map { $0.value })
///     // Prints "[67, 97, 102, 101, 769, 32, 100, 117, 32, 127757]"
///
/// The `unicodeScalars` view's elements comprise each Unicode scalar value in
/// the `cafe` string. In particular, because `cafe` was declared using the
/// decomposed form of the `"é"` character, `unicodeScalars` contains the
/// scalar values for both the letter `"e"` (101) and the accent character
/// `"´"` (769).
///
/// UTF-16 View
/// -----------
///
/// A string's `utf16` property is a collection of UTF-16 code units, the
/// 16-bit encoding form of the string's Unicode scalar values. Each code unit
/// is stored as a `UInt16` instance.
///
///     print(cafe.utf16.count)
///     // Prints "11"
///     print(Array(cafe.utf16))
///     // Prints "[67, 97, 102, 101, 769, 32, 100, 117, 32, 55356, 57101]"
///
/// The elements of the `utf16` view are the code units for the string when
/// encoded in UTF-16. These elements match those accessed through indexed
/// `NSString` APIs.
///
///     let nscafe = cafe as NSString
///     print(nscafe.length)
///     // Prints "11"
///     print(nscafe.character(at: 3))
///     // Prints "101"
///
/// UTF-8 View
/// ----------
///
/// A string's `utf8` property is a collection of UTF-8 code units, the 8-bit
/// encoding form of the string's Unicode scalar values. Each code unit is
/// stored as a `UInt8` instance.
///
///     print(cafe.utf8.count)
///     // Prints "14"
///     print(Array(cafe.utf8))
///     // Prints "[67, 97, 102, 101, 204, 129, 32, 100, 117, 32, 240, 159, 140, 141]"
///
/// The elements of the `utf8` view are the code units for the string when
/// encoded in UTF-8. This representation matches the one used when `String`
/// instances are passed to C APIs.
///
///     let cLength = strlen(cafe)
///     print(cLength)
///     // Prints "14"
///
/// Measuring the Length of a String
/// ================================
///
/// When you need to know the length of a string, you must first consider what
/// you'll use the length for. Are you measuring the number of characters that
/// will be displayed on the screen, or are you measuring the amount of
/// storage needed for the string in a particular encoding? A single string
/// can have greatly differing lengths when measured by its different views.
///
/// For example, an ASCII character like the capital letter *A* is represented
/// by a single element in each of its four views. The Unicode scalar value of
/// *A* is `65`, which is small enough to fit in a single code unit in both
/// UTF-16 and UTF-8.
///
///     let capitalA = "A"
///     print(capitalA.count)
///     // Prints "1"
///     print(capitalA.unicodeScalars.count)
///     // Prints "1"
///     print(capitalA.utf16.count)
///     // Prints "1"
///     print(capitalA.utf8.count)
///     // Prints "1"
///
/// On the other hand, an emoji flag character is constructed from a pair of
/// Unicode scalar values, like `"\u{1F1F5}"` and `"\u{1F1F7}"`. Each of these
/// scalar values, in turn, is too large to fit into a single UTF-16 or UTF-8
/// code unit. As a result, each view of the string `"🇵🇷"` reports a different
/// length.
///
///     let flag = "🇵🇷"
///     print(flag.count)
///     // Prints "1"
///     print(flag.unicodeScalars.count)
///     // Prints "2"
///     print(flag.utf16.count)
///     // Prints "4"
///     print(flag.utf8.count)
///     // Prints "8"
///
/// To check whether a string is empty, use its `isEmpty` property instead of
/// comparing the length of one of the views to `0`. Unlike with `isEmpty`,
/// calculating a view's `count` property requires iterating through the
/// elements of the string.
///
/// Accessing String View Elements
/// ==============================
///
/// To find individual elements of a string, use the appropriate view for your
/// task. For example, to retrieve the first word of a longer string, you can
/// search the string for a space and then create a new string from a prefix
/// of the string up to that point.
///
///     let name = "Marie Curie"
///     let firstSpace = name.firstIndex(of: " ") ?? name.endIndex
///     let firstName = name[..<firstSpace]
///     print(firstName)
///     // Prints "Marie"
///
/// Strings and their views share indices, so you can access the UTF-8 view of
/// the `name` string using the same `firstSpace` index.
///
///     print(Array(name.utf8[..<firstSpace]))
///     // Prints "[77, 97, 114, 105, 101]"
///
/// Note that an index into one view may not have an exact corresponding
/// position in another view. For example, the `flag` string declared above
/// comprises a single character, but is composed of eight code units when
/// encoded as UTF-8. The following code creates constants for the first and
/// second positions in the `flag.utf8` view. Accessing the `utf8` view with
/// these indices yields the first and second code UTF-8 units.
///
///     let firstCodeUnit = flag.startIndex
///     let secondCodeUnit = flag.utf8.index(after: firstCodeUnit)
///     // flag.utf8[firstCodeUnit] == 240
///     // flag.utf8[secondCodeUnit] == 159
///
/// When used to access the elements of the `flag` string itself, however, the
/// `secondCodeUnit` index does not correspond to the position of a specific
/// character. Instead of only accessing the specific UTF-8 code unit, that
/// index is treated as the position of the character at the index's encoded
/// offset. In the case of `secondCodeUnit`, that character is still the flag
/// itself.
///
///     // flag[firstCodeUnit] == "🇵🇷"
///     // flag[secondCodeUnit] == "🇵🇷"
///
/// If you need to validate that an index from one string's view corresponds
/// with an exact position in another view, use the index's
/// `samePosition(in:)` method or the `init(_:within:)` initializer.
///
///     if let exactIndex = secondCodeUnit.samePosition(in: flag) {
///         print(flag[exactIndex])
///     } else {
///         print("No exact match for this position.")
///     }
///     // Prints "No exact match for this position."
///
/// Performance Optimizations
/// =========================
///
/// Although strings in Swift have value semantics, strings use a copy-on-write
/// strategy to store their data in a buffer. This buffer can then be shared
/// by different copies of a string. A string's data is only copied lazily,
/// upon mutation, when more than one string instance is using the same
/// buffer. Therefore, the first in any sequence of mutating operations may
/// cost O(*n*) time and space.
///
/// When a string's contiguous storage fills up, a new buffer must be allocated
/// and data must be moved to the new storage. String buffers use an
/// exponential growth strategy that makes appending to a string a constant
/// time operation when averaged over many append operations.
///
/// Bridging Between String and NSString
/// ====================================
///
/// Any `String` instance can be bridged to `NSString` using the type-cast
/// operator (`as`), and any `String` instance that originates in Objective-C
/// may use an `NSString` instance as its storage. Because any arbitrary
/// subclass of `NSString` can become a `String` instance, there are no
/// guarantees about representation or efficiency when a `String` instance is
/// backed by `NSString` storage. Because `NSString` is immutable, it is just
/// as though the storage was shared by a copy. The first in any sequence of
/// mutating operations causes elements to be copied into unique, contiguous
/// storage which may cost O(*n*) time and space, where *n* is the length of
/// the string's encoded representation (or more, if the underlying `NSString`
/// has unusual performance characteristics).
///

/// the [Unicode.org glossary][glossary]. In particular, this discussion
/// mentions [extended grapheme clusters][clusters], [Unicode scalar
