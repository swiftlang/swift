/// A distributed actor system underpins and implements all functionality of distributed actors.
///
/// A ``DistributedActor`` is always initialized in association with some concrete actor system.
/// That actor system instance is then used to manage the identity of the actor, as well as
/// handle all remote interactions of the distributed actor.
///
/// ## Using a DistributedActorSystem library
///
/// From a library user's perspective (e.g. someone using a `ClusterSystem` or `SampleWebSocketActorSystem`),
/// the basic use of a distributed actor system is fairly opaque.
///
/// Any distributed actor must declare what actor system it is able to operate with. This is done either by a
/// `typealias ActorSystem` in the body of such `distributed actor` declaration, or a module-wide global
/// `typealias DefaultDistributedActorSystem`. Refer to the ``DistributedActor`` documentation to learn more
/// about the tradeoffs of these approaches.
///
/// Once an actor has declared the system it is able to work with, an instance of the system must be provided
/// at initialization time, in order for the system to be able to take over the actor's identity management.
///
/// For example, a simple distributed actor may look like this:
///
/// ```swift
/// distributed actor Greeter {
///   init(name: String, actorSystem: ActorSystem) {
///     self.name = name
///     self.actorSystem = actorSystem // required (!) initialization of implicit actorSystem property
///   }
/// }
/// ```
/// Notice that every distributed actor initializer must initialize the synthesized ``DistributedActor/actorSystem``.
/// This property is later used for identity management and other remote interactions of the actor.
/// For more details refer to ``DistributedActor`` which explains more about declaring distributed actors.
///
/// For more details about how the specific actor system implementation deals with remote message transports
/// and serialization, please refer to the specific system's documentation.
///
/// > Note: For example, you may refer to the [Swift Distributed Actors cluster library](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-actors/) documentation,
/// > which is one example of such feature complete distributed actor system implementation.
///
/// ## Implementing a DistributedActorSystem
///
/// This section is dedicated to distributed actor system library authors, and generally can be skipped over
/// by library users, as it explains the interactions of synthesized code and specific distributed actor system methods
/// and how they must be implemented.
///
/// Methods discussed in this section are generally not intended to be called directly, but instead will have calls
/// generated to them from distributed actor declarations in appropriate places (such as initializers, `distributed func` calls, or `distributed` computed properties).
///
/// ### Assigning and Resigning Actor Identifiers
///
/// During a local distributed actor's initialization (i.e. any `init` of a `distributed actor`), the actor system will
/// be invoked in order to assign an ``ActorID`` for this actor.
///
/// A call to ``assignID(_:)`` is made during the initialization of the distributed actor.
/// The snippet below showcases this, though no guarantees are made at this point about the exact placement of this call.
///
/// ```swift
/// distributed actor ShowcaseIDInit {
///   // let actorSystem: ActorSystem // synthesized;
///
///   // typealias ID = ActorSystem.ActorID
///   // let id: ID // synthesized; implements `Identifiable.id` requirement
///
///   init(actorSystem: ActorSystem) {
///     self.actorSystem = actorSystem
///     // ...
///     // self.id = actorSystem.assignID(Self.self) // synthesized;
///     // ...
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The result of ``assignID(_:)`` is then directly stored in the synthesized `id` property of the actor.
///
/// The actor system should assign _globally unique_ identifiers to types, such that they may be properly resolved
/// from any process in the distributed actor system. The exact shape of the ``ActorID`` is left up to the library to decide.
/// It can be as small as an integer based identifier, or as large as a series of key-value pairs identifying the actor.
///
/// The actor system must retain a mapping from the ``ActorID`` to the specific actor _instance_ which it is given in
/// ``actorReady(_:)`` in order to implement the ``resolve(id:using:)`` method, which is how incoming and outgoing remote calls are made possible.
///
/// Users have no control over this assignment, nor are they allowed to set the `id` property explicitly.
/// The ``DistributedActor/id`` is used to implement the distributed actor's ``Hashable``, ``Equatable``,
/// and even ``Codable`` conformance (which is synthesized if and only if the ``ActorID`` is ``Codable`` itself).
///
/// > Tip: Take note that throwing or failable initializers complicate this somewhat. Thankfully, the compiler
/// > will always emit the right code such that every ``assignID(_:)`` is balanced with a ``resignID(_:)`` call,
/// > when the actor either failed to initialize or deinitialize properly.
/// >
/// > It is also possible that a throwing initializer throws before assigning the `actorSystem` and `id` properties.
/// > In such case, no `assignID` nor `resignID` calls are made. There is no risk of the compiler ever attempting
/// > to call a `resignID(_:)` without first having assigned given ID.
///
/// Manually invoking `assignID` and `resignID` is generally not recommended but isn't strictly a programmer error,
/// and it is up to the actor system to decide how to deal with such calls.
///
/// Once the ``distributed actor`` deinitializes, a call to ``resignID(_:)`` will be made. Generally this is made from
/// the distributed actor's `deinit`, however in the case of throwing initializers it may also happen during such failed
/// init, in order to release the ID that is no longer used.
///
/// ```swift
/// // Synthesized inside a distributed actor's deinit:
/// deinit {
///   // actorSystem.resignID(self.id)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// After an ID is resigned, it technically could be used to identify another instance.
/// For example, an advanced actor system implementation could use such approach to implement actors which
/// are created "ad-hoc" and always contain the appropriate ID, and if one isn't allocated yet for such ID,
/// it could _then_ create one on demand and make sure it is assigned the required ID.
///
/// ### Readying Distributed Actors
///
/// Once a `distributed actor` has been _fully initialized_ during its initializer, a call to ``actorReady(_:)``
/// is synthesized. This call is made after the actor's properties (including all user-declared properties) have been
/// initialized, but before other user-defined code in the initializer gets a chance to run.
///
/// > Note: Generally due to actor initializer isolation rules, users will need to make their initializers `async`
/// in order to write code that safely performs extra actions after it has fully initialized.
///
/// The ``actorReady(_)`` call on the actor system is a signal to the actor system that this actor _instance_ is now ready
/// and may be resolved and interacted with via the actor system. Generally, a distributed actor system implementation
/// will _weakly retain_ the actors it has readied, because retaining them strongly would mean that they will never be
/// deallocated (and thus never resign their ID's).
///
/// > Note: Generally actor systems should retain actors _weakly_ in order to allow them be deinitialized when no longer in use.
/// >
/// > Sometimes though, it can be quite useful to have the system retain certain "well known" actors, for example when it is expected
/// > that other nodes in the distributed system will need to interact with them, even if end-user code no longer holds
/// > strong references to them. An example of such "retain while actor system is active" distributed actors would be any kind
/// > of actor which implements discovery or health check mechanisms between clustered nodes, sometimes called "system actors",
/// > i.e. actors that serve the actor system directly.
///
/// Next, we will discuss the just mentioned `resolve` method, which is closely tied to readying actors.
///
/// ### Resolving (potentially remote) Distributed Actors
///
/// An important aspect of any distributed actor system is being able to turn a ``DistributedActor`` type and ``ActorID``
/// into a reference to an actor (instance), regardless where the actor is located. The ID should have enough information stored
/// to be able to make the decision of _where_ the actor is located, without having to contact remote nodes. Specifically,
/// the implementation of ``DistributedActorSystem/resolve(id:as:)`` is _not_ `async` and should _not_ perform long running
/// or blocking operations in order to return.
///
/// > Note: Currently only concrete distributed actors types can be resolved.
///
/// The actor system's ``DistributedActorSystem/resolve(id:as:)`` method is called by the compiler whenever end-users
/// call the ``DistributedActor``'s ``DistributedActor/resolve(id:using:)`` method. The return types of those methods differ,
/// as the actor system's return type is `Act?` (and it may throw if unable to resolve the `ActorID`).
///
/// The actor system's `resolve` returning `nil` means that the ``ActorID`` passed to it refers to a _remote_
/// distributed actor. The Swift runtime reacts to this by creating a remote actor reference (sometimes called a "proxy").
///
///
/// ### Handling remote calls
///
/// Finally, calls on a _remote_ distributed actor reference's distributed methods are turned into invocations of
/// `remoteCall(on:target:invocation:returning:throwing:)` (or `remoteCallVoid(on:target:invocation:throwing:)` for Void returning methods).
///
/// Implementing the remote calls correctly and efficiently is the important task for a distributed actor system library.
///
/// Implementations of remote calls generally will serialize `actor.id`, `target` and `invocation`
/// into some form of wire envelope, and send it over the network (or process boundary) using some
/// transport mechanism of their choice. As they do so, they need to suspend the `remoteCall` function,
/// and resume it once a reply to the call arrives. Unless the transport layer is also async/await aware,
/// this will often require making use of a ``CheckedContinuation``.
///
/// While implementing remote calls please keep in mind any potential failure scenarios that may occur,
/// such as message loss, connection failures and similar issues. Such situations should all be
/// surfaced by resuming the `remoteCall` by throwing an error conforming to ``DistributedActorSystemError``.
///
/// While it is not _required_ to conform error thrown out of these methods to ``DistributedActorSystemError``,
/// the general guideline about conforming errors to this protocol is that errors which are outside of the user's control,
/// but are thrown because transport or actor system issues, should conform to it. This is to simplify
/// separating "business logic errors" from transport errors.
///
///

/// you can refer to the following Swift Evolution proposals:
