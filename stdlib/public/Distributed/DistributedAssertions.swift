  /// Assume that the current task is executing on this (local) distributed
  /// actor's serial executor, or stop program execution otherwise.

  /// This method allows to *assume and verify* that the currently
  /// executing synchronous function is actually executing on the serial
  /// executor of the this (local) distributed actor.
  ///
  /// If that is the case, the operation is invoked isolated to the main actor
  /// (`@MainActor () -> T`), allowing synchronous access to actor local state
  /// without hopping through asynchronous boundaries.
  ///
  /// If the current context is not running on the actor's serial executor,
  /// this method will crash with a fatal error (similar
  /// to ``preconditionIsolated()``).
  ///
  /// This method can only be used from synchronous functions, as asynchronous
  /// functions should instead perform a normal method call to the actor, which
  /// will hop task execution to the target actor if necessary.
  ///
  /// - Note: This check is performed against the actor's serial executor,
  ///   meaning that / if another actor uses the same serial executor--by using
  ///   another actor's executor as its own ``DistributedActor/unownedExecutor``
  ///   --this check will succeed , as from a concurrency safety perspective,
  ///   the serial executor guarantees mutual exclusion of those two actors.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - operation: the operation that will be executed if the current context
  ///                is executing on the actors serial executor, and the actor
  ///                is a local reference.
  ///   - file: The file name to print if the assertion fails. The default is
  ///           where this method was called.
  ///   - line: The line number to print if the assertion fails The default is
  ///           where this method was called.
  /// - Returns: the return value of the `operation`
