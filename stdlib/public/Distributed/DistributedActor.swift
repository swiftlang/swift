// ==== Distributed Actor -----------------------------------------------------

/// Common protocol to which all distributed actors conform implicitly.
///
/// The `DistributedActor` protocol generalizes over all distributed actor types.
/// Distributed actor types implicitly conform to this protocol.
///
/// It is not possible to conform to this protocol by any other declaration other than a `distributed actor`.
///
/// It is possible to require a type to conform to the
/// ``DistributedActor`` protocol by refining it with another protocol,
/// or by using a generic constraint.
///
/// ## Synthesized properties
/// For every concrete distributed actor declaration, the compiler synthesizes two properties: `actorSystem` and `id`.
/// They witness the ``actorSystem`` and ``id`` protocol requirements of the ``DistributedActor`` protocol.
///
/// It is not possible to implement these properties explicitly in user code.
/// These properties are `nonisolated` and accessible even if the instance is _remote_,
/// because _all_ distributed actor references must store the actor system remote calls
/// will be delivered through, as well as the id identifying the target of those calls.
///
/// ## The ActorSystem associated type
/// Every distributed actor must declare what type of actor system
/// it is part of by implementing the ``ActorSystem`` associated type requirement.
///
/// This causes a number of other properties of the actor to be inferred:
///   - the ``SerializationRequirement`` that will be used at compile time to
///     verify `distributed` target declarations are well formed,
///   - if the distributed actor is `Codable`, based on the ``ID`` being Codable or not,
///   - the type of the ``ActorSystem`` accepted in the synthesized default initializer.
///
/// A distributed actor must declare what type of actor system it is ready to
/// work with by fulfilling the ``ActorSystem`` type member requirement:
///
/// ```swift
/// distributed actor Greeter {
///   typealias ActorSystem = GreetingSystem // which conforms to DistributedActorSystem
///
///   func greet() -> String { "Hello!" }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### The DefaultDistributedActorSystem type alias
/// Since it is fairly common to only be using one specific type of actor system
/// within a module or entire codebase, it is possible to declare the default type
/// of actor system all distributed actors will be using in a module by declaring
/// a `DefaultDistributedActorSystem` module wide typealias:
///
/// ```swift
/// import Distributed
/// import AmazingActorSystemLibrary
///
/// typealias DefaultDistributedActorSystem = AmazingActorSystem
///
/// distributed actor Greeter {} // ActorSystem == AmazingActorSystem
/// ```
///
/// This declaration makes all `distributed actor` declarations
/// that do not explicitly specify an ``ActorSystem`` type alias to assume the
/// `AmazingActorSystem` as their `ActorSystem`.
///
/// It is possible for a specific actor to override the system it is using,
/// by declaring an ``ActorSystem`` type alias as usual:
///
/// ```swift
/// typealias DefaultDistributedActorSystem = AmazingActorSystem
///
/// distributed actor Amazing {
///   // ActorSystem == AmazingActorSystem
/// }
///
/// distributed actor Superb {
///   typealias ActorSystem = SuperbActorSystem
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In general the `DefaultDistributedActorSystem` should not be declared public,
/// as picking the default should be left up to each specific module of a project.
///
/// ## Default initializer
/// While classes and actors receive a synthesized *argument-free default
/// initializer* (`init()`), distributed actors synthesize a default initializer
/// that accepts a distributed actor system the actor is part of: `init(actorSystem:)`.
///
/// The accepted actor system must be of the `Self.ActorSystem` type, which
/// must conform to the ``DistributedActorSystem`` protocol. This is required
/// because distributed actors are always managed by a concrete
/// distributed actor system and cannot exist on their own without one.
///
/// It is possible to explicitly declare a parameter-free initializer (`init()`),
/// however the `actorSystem` property still must be assigned a concrete actor
/// system instance the actor shall be part of.
///
/// In general it is recommended to always have an `actorSystem` parameter as
/// the last non-defaulted non-closure parameter in every actor's
/// initializer parameter list. This way it is simple to swap in a "test actor
/// system" instance in unit tests, and avoid relying on global state which could
/// make testing more difficult.
///
/// ## Implicit properties
/// Every concrete `distributed actor` type receives two synthesized properties,
/// which implement the protocol requirements of this protocol: `id` and `actorSystem`.
///
/// ### Property: Actor System
/// The ``actorSystem`` property is an important part of every distributed actor's lifecycle management.
///
/// Both initialization as well as de-initialization require interactions with the actor system,
/// and it is the actor system that handles all remote interactions of an actor, by both sending
/// or receiving remote calls made on the actor.
///
/// The ``actorSystem`` property must be assigned in every designated initializer
/// of a distributed actor explicitly. It is highly recommended to make it a
/// parameter of every distributed actor initializer, and simply forward the
/// value to the stored property, like this:
///
/// ```swift
/// init(name: String, actorSystem: Self.ActorSystem) {
///   self.name = name
///   self.actorSystem = actorSystem
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Forgetting to initialize the actor system, will result in a compile time error:
///
/// ```swift
/// // BAD
/// init(name: String, actorSystem: Self.ActorSystem) {
///   self.name = name
///   // BAD, will cause compile-time error; the `actorSystem` was not initialized.
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Property: Distributed Actor Identity
/// ``id`` is assigned by the actor system during the distributed actor's
/// initialization, and cannot be set or mutated by the actor itself.
///
/// ``id`` is the effective identity of the actor, and is used in equality checks,
/// as well as the actor's synthesized ``Codable`` conformance if the ``ID`` type
/// conforms to ``Codable``.
///
/// ## Automatic Conformances
///
/// ### Hashable and Identifiable conformance
/// Every distributed actor conforms to the `Hashable` and `Identifiable` protocols.
/// Its identity is strictly driven by its ``id``, and therefore hash and equality
/// implementations directly delegate to the ``id`` property.
///
/// Comparing a local distributed actor instance and a remote reference to it
/// (both using the same ``id``) always returns true, as they both conceptually
/// point at the same distributed actor.
///
/// It is not possible to implement these protocols relying on the actual actor's
/// state, because it may be remote and the state may not be available. In other
/// words, since these protocols must be implemented using `nonisolated` functions,
/// only `nonisolated` `id` and `actorSystem` properties are accessible for their
/// implementations.
///
/// ### Implicit Codable conformance
/// If created with an actor system whose ``DistributedActorSystem/ActorID`` is ``Codable``, the
/// compiler will synthesize code for the concrete distributed actor to conform
/// to ``Codable`` as well.
///
/// This is necessary to support distributed calls where the `SerializationRequirement`
/// is ``Codable`` and thus users may want to pass actors as arguments to remote calls.
///
/// The synthesized implementations use a single ``SingleValueEncodingContainer`` to
/// encode/decode the ``id`` property of the actor. The ``Decoder`` required
/// ``Decoder/init(from:)`` is implemented by retrieving an actor system from the
/// decoders' `userInfo`, effectively like as follows:
///
/// ```swift
/// decoder.userInfo[.actorSystemKey] as? ActorSystem
// ```
///
/// The such obtained actor system is then used to ``resolve(id:using:)`` the decoded ``ID``.
///
/// Use the ``CodingUserInfoKey/actorSystemKey`` to provide the necessary
/// actor system for the decoding initializer when decoding a distributed actor.
///
