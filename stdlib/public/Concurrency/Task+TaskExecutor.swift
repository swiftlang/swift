/// Configure the current task hierarchy's task executor preference to the passed ``TaskExecutor``,
/// and execute the passed in closure by immediately hopping to that executor.
///
/// ### Task executor preference semantics
/// Task executors influence _where_ nonisolated asynchronous functions, and default actor methods execute.
/// The preferred executor will be used whenever possible, rather than hopping to the global concurrent pool.
///
/// For an in depth discussion of this topic, see ``TaskExecutor``.
///
/// ### Disabling task executor preference
/// Passing `nil` as executor means disabling any preference preference (if it was set) and the task hierarchy
/// will execute without any executor preference until a different preference is set.
///
/// ### Asynchronous function execution semantics in presence of task executor preferences
/// The following diagram illustrates on which executor an `async` function will
/// execute, in presence (or lack thereof) a task executor preference.
///
/// ```

/// In short, without a task executor preference, `nonisolated async` functions

///
/// Isolated functions semantically execute on the actor they are isolated to,
/// however if such actor does not declare a custom executor (it is a "default
/// actor") in presence of a task executor preference, tasks executing on this
/// actor will use the preferred executor as source of threads to run the task,
/// while isolated on the actor.

///
///     Task {
///       // case 0) "no task executor preference"
///
///       // default task executor
///       // ...
///       await SomeDefaultActor().hello() // default executor
///       await ActorWithCustomExecutor().hello() // 'hello' executes on actor's custom executor
///

///       async let x = ...
///       await withTaskGroup(of: Int.self) { group in g.addTask { 7 } }
///
///       await withTaskExecutorPreference(specific) {
///         // case 1) 'specific' task executor preference
///
///         // 'specific' task executor
///         // ...
///         await SomeDefaultActor().hello() // 'hello' executes on 'specific' executor
///         await ActorWithCustomExecutor().hello() // 'hello' executes on actor's custom executor (same as case 0)

///           group.addTask { 7 } // child task executes on 'specific' executor
///           group.addTask(executorPreference: globalConcurrentExecutor) { 13 } // child task executes on global concurrent executor
///         }
///
///         // disable the task executor preference:
///         await withTaskExecutorPreference(globalConcurrentExecutor) {
///           // equivalent to case 0) preference is globalConcurrentExecutor
///
