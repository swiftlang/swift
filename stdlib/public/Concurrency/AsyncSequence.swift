import Swift

/// A type that provides asynchronous, sequential, iterated access to its
/// elements.
///
/// An `AsyncSequence` resembles the `Sequence` type --- offering a list of
/// values you can step through one at a time --- and adds asynchronicity. An
/// `AsyncSequence` may have all, some, or none of its values available when
/// you first use it. Instead, you use `await` to receive values as they become
/// available.
///
/// As with `Sequence`, you typically iterate through an `AsyncSequence` with a
/// `for await`-`in` loop. However, because the caller must potentially wait for values,
/// you use the `await` keyword. The following example shows how to iterate
/// over `Counter`, a custom `AsyncSequence` that produces `Int` values from
/// `1` up to a `howHigh` value:
///
///     for await number in Counter(howHigh: 10) {
///         print(number, terminator: " ")
///     }
///     // Prints "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 "
///
/// An `AsyncSequence` doesn't generate or contain the values; it just defines
/// how you access them. Along with defining the type of values as an associated
/// type called `Element`, the `AsyncSequence` defines a `makeAsyncIterator()`
/// method. This returns an instance of type `AsyncIterator`. Like the standard
/// `IteratorProtocol`, the `AsyncIteratorProtocol` defines a single `next()`
/// method to produce elements. The difference is that the `AsyncIterator`
/// defines its `next()` method as `async`, which requires a caller to wait for
/// the next value with the `await` keyword.
///
/// `AsyncSequence` also defines methods for processing the elements you
/// receive, modeled on the operations provided by the basic `Sequence` in the
/// standard library. There are two categories of methods: those that return a
/// single value, and those that return another `AsyncSequence`.
///
/// Single-value methods eliminate the need for a `for await`-`in` loop, and instead
/// let you make a single `await` call. For example, the `contains(_:)` method
/// returns a Boolean value that indicates if a given value exists in the
/// `AsyncSequence`. Given the `Counter` sequence from the previous example,
/// you can test for the existence of a sequence member with a one-line call:
///
///     let found = await Counter(howHigh: 10).contains(5) // true
///
/// Methods that return another `AsyncSequence` return a type specific to the
/// method's semantics. For example, the `.map(_:)` method returns a
/// `AsyncMapSequence` (or a `AsyncThrowingMapSequence`, if the closure you
/// provide to the `map(_:)` method can throw an error). These returned
/// sequences don't eagerly await the next member of the sequence, which allows
/// the caller to decide when to start work. Typically, you'll iterate over
/// these sequences with `for await`-`in`, like the base `AsyncSequence` you started
/// with. In the following example, the `map(_:)` method transforms each `Int`
/// received from a `Counter` sequence into a `String`:
///
///     let stream = Counter(howHigh: 10)
///         .map { $0 % 2 == 0 ? "Even" : "Odd" }
///     for await s in stream {
///         print(s, terminator: " ")
///     }
///     // Prints "Odd Even Odd Even Odd Even Odd Even Odd Even "
///
