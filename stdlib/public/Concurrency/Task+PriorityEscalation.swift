// ==== Task Priority Escalation Handlers --------------------------------------

/// Runs the passed `operation` while registering a task priority escalation handler.
/// The handler will be triggered concurrently to the current task if the current
/// is subject to priority escalation.
///
/// The handler may perform additional actions upon priority escalation,
/// but cannot influence how the escalation influences the task, i.e. the task's
/// priority will be escalated regardless of actions performed in the handler.
///
/// The handler will only trigger if a priority escalation occurs while the
/// operation is in progress.
///
/// If multiple task escalation handlers are nester they will all be triggered.
///
/// Task escalation propagates through structured concurrency child-tasks.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - operation: the operation during which to listen for priority escalation
///   - handler: handler to invoke, concurrently to `operation`,
///              when priority escalation happens
/// - Returns: the value returned by `operation`
/// - Throws: when the `operation` throws an error
