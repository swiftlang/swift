/// Routines related to the global concurrent execution service.
///
/// The execution side of Swift's concurrency model centers around
/// scheduling work onto various execution services ("executors").
/// Executors vary in several different dimensions:
///
/// First, executors may be exclusive or concurrent.  An exclusive
/// executor can only execute one job at once; a concurrent executor
/// can execute many.  Exclusive executors are usually used to achieve
/// some higher-level requirement, like exclusive access to some
/// resource or memory.  Concurrent executors are usually used to
/// manage a pool of threads and prevent the number of allocated
/// threads from growing without limit.
///
/// Second, executors may own dedicated threads, or they may schedule
/// work onto some underlying executor.  Dedicated threads can
/// improve the responsiveness of a subsystem *locally*, but they impose
/// substantial costs which can drive down performance *globally*
/// if not used carefully.  When an executor relies on running work
/// on its own dedicated threads, jobs that need to run briefly on
/// that executor may need to suspend and restart.  Dedicating threads
/// to an executor is a decision that should be made carefully
/// and holistically.
///
/// If most executors should not have dedicated threads, they must
/// be backed by some underlying executor, typically a concurrent
/// executor.  The purpose of most concurrent executors is to
/// manage threads and prevent excessive growth in the number
/// of threads.  Having multiple independent concurrent executors
/// with their own dedicated threads would undermine that.
/// Therefore, it is sensible to have a single, global executor
/// that will ultimately schedule most of the work in the system.
/// With that as a baseline, special needs can be recognized and
/// carved out from the global executor with its cooperation.
///
/// This file defines Swift's interface to that global executor.
///
/// The default implementation is backed by libdispatch, but there
/// may be good reasons to provide alternatives (e.g. when building
/// a single-threaded runtime).
