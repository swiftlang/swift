// ==== Task Cancellation ------------------------------------------------------

/// Execute an operation with a cancellation handler that's immediately
/// invoked if the current task is canceled.
///
/// This differs from the operation cooperatively checking for cancellation
/// and reacting to it in that the cancellation handler is _always_ and
/// _immediately_ invoked when the task is canceled. For example, even if the
/// operation is running code that never checks for cancellation, a cancellation
/// handler still runs and provides a chance to run some cleanup code:
///
/// ```
/// await withTaskCancellationHandler {
///   var sum = 0
///   while condition {
///     sum += 1
///   }
///   return sum
/// } onCancel: {
///   // This onCancel closure might execute concurrently with the operation.
///   condition.cancel()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Execution order and semantics
/// The `operation` closure is always invoked, even when the
/// `withTaskCancellationHandler(operation:onCancel:)` method is called from a task
/// that was already cancelled.
///
/// When `withTaskCancellationHandler(operation:onCancel:)` is used in a task that has already been
/// cancelled, the cancellation handler will be executed
/// immediately before the `operation` closure gets to execute.
///
/// This allows the cancellation handler to set some external "cancelled" flag
/// that the operation may be *atomically* checking for in order to avoid
/// performing any actual work once the operation gets to run.
///
/// The `operation` closure executes on the calling execution context, and doesn't
/// suspend or change execution context unless code contained within the closure
/// does so. In other words, the potential suspension point of the
/// `withTaskCancellationHandler(operation:onCancel:)` never suspends by itself before
/// executing the operation.
///
/// If cancellation occurs while the operation is running, the cancellation
/// handler executes *concurrently* with the operation.
///
/// ### Cancellation handlers and locks
///
/// Cancellation handlers which acquire locks must take care to avoid deadlock.
/// The cancellation handler may be invoked while holding internal locks
/// associated with the task or other tasks.  Other operations on the task, such
/// as resuming a continuation, may acquire these same internal locks.
/// Therefore, if a cancellation handler must acquire a lock, other code should
/// not cancel tasks or resume continuations while holding that lock.
