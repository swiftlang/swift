import Swift

/// A mechanism in which to measure time, and delay work until a given point
/// in time.
///
/// Types that conform to the `Clock` protocol define a concept of "now" which
/// is the specific instant in time that property is accessed. Any pair of calls
/// to the `now` property may have a minimum duration between them - this
/// minimum resolution is exposed by the `minimumResolution` property to inform
/// any user of the type the expected granularity of accuracy.
///
/// One of the primary uses for clocks is to schedule task sleeping. This method
/// resumes the calling task after a given deadline has been met or passed with
/// a given tolerance value. The tolerance is expected as a leeway around the
/// deadline. The clock may reschedule tasks within the tolerance to ensure
/// efficient execution of resumptions by reducing potential operating system
/// wake-ups. If no tolerance is specified (i.e. nil is passed in) the sleep
/// function is expected to schedule with a default tolerance strategy.
///
/// For more information about specific clocks see `ContinuousClock` and
/// `SuspendingClock`.
