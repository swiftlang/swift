// ==== Task -------------------------------------------------------------------

/// A unit of asynchronous work.
///
/// When you create an instance of `Task`,
/// you provide a closure that contains the work for that task to perform.
/// Tasks can start running immediately after creation;
/// you don't explicitly start or schedule them.
/// After creating a task, you use the instance to interact with it ---
/// for example, to wait for it to complete or to cancel it.
/// It's not a programming error to discard a reference to a task
/// without waiting for that task to finish or canceling it.
/// A task runs regardless of whether you keep a reference to it.
/// However, if you discard the reference to a task,
/// you give up the ability
/// to wait for that task's result or cancel the task.
///
/// To support operations on the current task,
/// which can be either a detached task or child task,
/// `Task` also exposes class methods like `yield()`.
/// Because these methods are asynchronous,
/// they're always invoked as part of an existing task.
///
/// Only code that's running as part of the task can interact with that task.
/// To interact with the current task,
/// you call one of the static methods on `Task`.
///
/// A task's execution can be seen as a series of periods where the task ran.
/// Each such period ends at a suspension point or the
/// completion of the task.
/// These periods of execution are represented by instances of `PartialAsyncTask`.
/// Unless you're implementing a custom executor,
/// you don't directly interact with partial tasks.
///
/// For information about the language-level concurrency model that `Task` is part of,
/// see [Concurrency][concurrency] in [The Swift Programming Language][tspl].

/// Task Cancellation
/// =================
///
/// Tasks include a shared mechanism for indicating cancellation,
/// but not a shared implementation for how to handle cancellation.
/// Depending on the work you're doing in the task,
/// the correct way to stop that work varies.
/// Likewise,
/// it's the responsibility of the code running as part of the task
/// to check for cancellation whenever stopping is appropriate.
/// In a long-task that includes multiple pieces,
/// you might need to check for cancellation at several points,
/// and handle cancellation differently at each point.
/// If you only need to throw an error to stop the work,
/// call the `Task.checkCancellation()` function to check for cancellation.
/// Other responses to cancellation include
/// returning the work completed so far, returning an empty result, or returning `nil`.
///
/// Cancellation is a purely Boolean state;
/// there's no way to include additional information
/// like the reason for cancellation.
/// This reflects the fact that a task can be canceled for many reasons,
/// and additional reasons can accrue during the cancellation process.
///
/// ### Task closure lifetime
/// Tasks are initialized by passing a closure containing the code that will be executed by a given task.
///
/// After this code has run to completion, the task has completed, resulting in either
/// a failure or result value, this closure is eagerly released.
///
/// Retaining a task object doesn't indefinitely retain the closure,
/// because any references that a task holds are released
/// after the task completes.
/// Consequently, tasks rarely need to capture weak references to values.
///
/// For example, in the following snippet of code it is not necessary to capture the actor as `weak`,
/// because as the task completes it'll let go of the actor reference, breaking the
/// reference cycle between the Task and the actor holding it.
///
/// ```
/// struct Work: Sendable {}
///
/// actor Worker {
///     var work: Task<Void, Never>?
///     var result: Work?
///
///     deinit {
///         // even though the task is still retained,
///         // once it completes it no longer causes a reference cycle with the actor
///
///         print("deinit actor")
///     }
///
///     func start() {
///         work = Task {
///             print("start task work")
///             try? await Task.sleep(for: .seconds(3))
///             self.result = Work() // we captured self
///             print("completed task work")
///             // but as the task completes, this reference is released
///         }
///         // we keep a strong reference to the task
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// And using it like this:
///
/// ```
/// await Worker().start()
/// ```
///
/// Note that the actor is only retained by the start() method's use of `self`,
/// and that the start method immediately returns, without waiting for the
/// unstructured `Task` to finish. Once the task is completed and its closure is
/// destroyed, the strong reference to the actor is also released allowing the
/// actor to deinitialize as expected.
///
/// Therefore, the above call will consistently result in the following output:
///
/// ```other
/// start task work
/// completed task work
/// deinit actor
/// ```

  ///   those created in the future. If those tasks have cancellation handlers,
  ///   they also are triggered.
  ///
  /// Task cancellation is cooperative and idempotent.
  ///
  /// Cancelling a task does not automatically cause arbitrary functions on the task
  /// to stop running or throw errors. A function _may_ choose to react
  /// to cancellation by ending its work early, and it is conventional to
  /// signal that to callers by throwing `CancellationError`. However,
  /// a function that doesn't specifically check for cancellation will
  /// run to completion normally, even if the task it is running on is
  /// canceled. However, that function might still end early if it calls
  /// other code that handles cancellation by throwing and that function doesn't
  /// handle the error.
  ///
  /// It's safe to cancel a task from any task or thread. It's safe for
  /// multiple tasks or threads to cancel the same task at the same
  /// time. Cancelling a task that has already been canceled has no
  /// additional effect.
  ///
  /// `cancel` may need to acquire locks and synchronously run
  /// arbitrary cancellation-handler code associated with the
  /// canceled task. To reduce the risk of deadlock, it is
  /// recommended that callers release any locks they might be
  /// holding before they call cancel.
  ///
  /// If the task has already run past the last point where it could have
  /// performed a cancellation check, cancelling it may have no observable effects.

/// because they aren't attached to the current task.

///
/// - If a task runs on behalf of an actor,

///   then the actor's current task is temporarily elevated
///   to the priority of the enqueued task.

///   to be processed at the priority it was enqueued with.
/// - If a higher-priority task calls the `get()` method,
///   then the priority of this task increases until the task completes.

/// from blocking the execution of a high priority task,
