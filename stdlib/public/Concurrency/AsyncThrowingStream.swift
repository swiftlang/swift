/// An asynchronous sequence generated from an error-throwing closure that
/// calls a continuation to produce new elements.
///
/// `AsyncThrowingStream` conforms to `AsyncSequence`, providing a convenient
/// way to create an asynchronous sequence without manually implementing an
/// asynchronous iterator. In particular, an asynchronous stream is well-suited
/// to adapt callback- or delegation-based APIs to participate with
/// `async`-`await`.
///
/// In contrast to `AsyncStream`, this type can throw an error from the awaited
/// `next()`, which terminates the stream with the thrown error.
///
/// You initialize an `AsyncThrowingStream` with a closure that receives an
/// `AsyncThrowingStream.Continuation`. Produce elements in this closure, then
/// provide them to the stream by calling the continuation's `yield(_:)` method.
/// When there are no further elements to produce, call the continuation's
/// `finish()` method. This causes the sequence iterator to produce a `nil`,
/// which terminates the sequence. If an error occurs, call the continuation's
/// `finish(throwing:)` method, which causes the iterator's `next()` method to
/// throw the error to the awaiting call point. The continuation is `Sendable`,
/// which permits calling it from concurrent contexts external to the iteration
/// of the `AsyncThrowingStream`.
///
/// An arbitrary source of elements can produce elements faster than they are
/// consumed by a caller iterating over them. Because of this, `AsyncThrowingStream`
/// defines a buffering behavior, allowing the stream to buffer a specific
/// number of oldest or newest elements. By default, the buffer limit is
/// `Int.max`, which means it's unbounded.
///
/// ### Adapting Existing Code to Use Streams
///
/// To adapt existing callback code to use `async`-`await`, use the callbacks
/// to provide values to the stream, by using the continuation's `yield(_:)`
/// method.
///
/// Consider a hypothetical `QuakeMonitor` type that provides callers with
/// `Quake` instances every time it detects an earthquake. To receive callbacks,
/// callers set a custom closure as the value of the monitor's
/// `quakeHandler` property, which the monitor calls back as necessary. Callers
/// can also set an `errorHandler` to receive asynchronous error notifications,
/// such as the monitor service suddenly becoming unavailable.
///
///     class QuakeMonitor {
///         var quakeHandler: ((Quake) -> Void)?
///         var errorHandler: ((Error) -> Void)?
///
///         func startMonitoring() {…}
///         func stopMonitoring() {…}
///     }
///
/// To adapt this to use `async`-`await`, extend the `QuakeMonitor` to add a
/// `quakes` property, of type `AsyncThrowingStream<Quake>`. In the getter for
/// this property, return an `AsyncThrowingStream`, whose `build` closure --
/// called at runtime to create the stream -- uses the continuation to
/// perform the following steps:
///
/// 1. Creates a `QuakeMonitor` instance.
/// 2. Sets the monitor's `quakeHandler` property to a closure that receives
/// each `Quake` instance and forwards it to the stream by calling the
/// continuation's `yield(_:)` method.
/// 3. Sets the monitor's `errorHandler` property to a closure that receives
/// any error from the monitor and forwards it to the stream by calling the
/// continuation's `finish(throwing:)` method. This causes the stream's
/// iterator to throw the error and terminate the stream.
/// 4. Sets the continuation's `onTermination` property to a closure that
/// calls `stopMonitoring()` on the monitor.
/// 5. Calls `startMonitoring` on the `QuakeMonitor`.
///
/// ```
/// extension QuakeMonitor {
///
///     static var throwingQuakes: AsyncThrowingStream<Quake, Error> {
///         AsyncThrowingStream { continuation in
///             let monitor = QuakeMonitor()
///             monitor.quakeHandler = { quake in
///                  continuation.yield(quake)
///             }
///             monitor.errorHandler = { error in
///                 continuation.finish(throwing: error)
///             }
///             continuation.onTermination = { @Sendable _ in
///                 monitor.stopMonitoring()
///             }
///             monitor.startMonitoring()
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
///
/// Because the stream is an `AsyncSequence`, the call point uses the
/// `for`-`await`-`in` syntax to process each `Quake` instance as produced by the stream:
///
///     do {
///         for try await quake in quakeStream {
///             print("Quake: \(quake.date)")
///         }
///         print("Stream done.")
///     } catch {
///         print("Error: \(error)")
