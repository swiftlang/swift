// ==== TaskGroup --------------------------------------------------------------

/// Starts a new task group which provides a scope in which a dynamic number of
/// tasks may be spawned.
///
/// Tasks added to the group by `group.spawn()` will automatically be awaited on
/// when the scope exits. If the group exits by throwing, all added tasks will
/// be cancelled and their results discarded.
///
/// ### Implicit awaiting
/// When the group returns it will implicitly await for all spawned tasks to
/// complete. The tasks are only cancelled if `cancelAll()` was invoked before
/// returning, the groups' task was cancelled, or the group body has thrown.
///
/// When results of tasks added to the group need to be collected, one can
/// gather their results using the following pattern:
///
///     while let result = await group.next() {
///       // some accumulation logic (e.g. sum += result)
///     }
///
/// It is also possible to collect results from the group by using its
/// `AsyncSequence` conformance, which enables its use in an asynchronous for-loop,
/// like this:
///
///     for await result in group {
///       // some accumulation logic (e.g. sum += result)
///      }
///
/// ### Cancellation
/// If the task that the group is running in is cancelled, the group becomes 
/// cancelled and all child tasks spawned in the group are cancelled as well.
/// 
/// Since the `withTaskGroup` provided group is specifically non-throwing,
/// child tasks (or the group) cannot react to cancellation by throwing a 
/// `CancellationError`, however they may interrupt their work and e.g. return 
/// some best-effort approximation of their work. 
///
/// If throwing is a good option for the kinds of tasks spawned by the group,
/// consider using the `withThrowingTaskGroup` function instead.
///
/// Postcondition:
/// Once `withTaskGroup` returns it is guaranteed that the `group` is *empty*.
///
/// This is achieved in the following way:
/// - if the body returns normally:
///   - the group will await any not yet complete tasks,
///   - once the `withTaskGroup` returns the group is guaranteed to be empty.

//    conflicting conformance of 'TaskGroup<ChildTaskResult, Failure>' to protocol
//    'AsyncSequence'; there cannot be more than one conformance, even with

// So, sadly we're forced to duplicate the entire implementation of TaskGroup
// to TaskGroup and ThrowingTaskGroup.

// The throwing task group is parameterized with failure only because of future
