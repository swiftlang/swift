/// An asynchronous sequence generated from a closure that calls a continuation
/// to produce new elements.
///
/// `AsyncStream` conforms to `AsyncSequence`, providing a convenient way to
/// create an asynchronous sequence without manually implementing an
/// asynchronous iterator. In particular, an asynchronous stream is well-suited
/// to adapt callback- or delegation-based APIs to participate with
/// `async`-`await`.
///
/// You initialize an `AsyncStream` with a closure that receives an
/// `AsyncStream.Continuation`. Produce elements in this closure, then provide
/// them to the stream by calling the continuation's `yield(_:)` method. When
/// there are no further elements to produce, call the continuation's
/// `finish()` method. This causes the sequence iterator to produce a `nil`,
/// which terminates the sequence. The continuation conforms to `Sendable`, which permits
/// calling it from concurrent contexts external to the iteration of the
/// `AsyncStream`.
///
/// An arbitrary source of elements can produce elements faster than they are
/// consumed by a caller iterating over them. Because of this, `AsyncStream`
/// defines a buffering behavior, allowing the stream to buffer a specific
/// number of oldest or newest elements. By default, the buffer limit is
/// `Int.max`, which means the value is unbounded.
///
/// ### Adapting Existing Code to Use Streams
///
/// To adapt existing callback code to use `async`-`await`, use the callbacks
/// to provide values to the stream, by using the continuation's `yield(_:)`
/// method.
///
/// Consider a hypothetical `QuakeMonitor` type that provides callers with
/// `Quake` instances every time it detects an earthquake. To receive callbacks,
/// callers set a custom closure as the value of the monitor's
/// `quakeHandler` property, which the monitor calls back as necessary.
///
///     class QuakeMonitor {
///         var quakeHandler: ((Quake) -> Void)?
///
///         func startMonitoring() {…}
///         func stopMonitoring() {…}
///     }
///
/// To adapt this to use `async`-`await`, extend the `QuakeMonitor` to add a
/// `quakes` property, of type `AsyncStream<Quake>`. In the getter for this
/// property, return an `AsyncStream`, whose `build` closure -- called at
/// runtime to create the stream -- uses the continuation to perform the
/// following steps:
///
/// 1. Creates a `QuakeMonitor` instance.
/// 2. Sets the monitor's `quakeHandler` property to a closure that receives
/// each `Quake` instance and forwards it to the stream by calling the
/// continuation's `yield(_:)` method.
/// 3. Sets the continuation's `onTermination` property to a closure that
/// calls `stopMonitoring()` on the monitor.
/// 4. Calls `startMonitoring` on the `QuakeMonitor`.
///
/// ```
/// extension QuakeMonitor {
///
///     static var quakes: AsyncStream<Quake> {
///         AsyncStream { continuation in
///             let monitor = QuakeMonitor()
///             monitor.quakeHandler = { quake in
///                 continuation.yield(quake)
///             }
///             continuation.onTermination = { @Sendable _ in
///                  monitor.stopMonitoring()
///             }
///             monitor.startMonitoring()
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Because the stream is an `AsyncSequence`, the call point can use the
/// `for`-`await`-`in` syntax to process each `Quake` instance as the stream
/// produces it:
///
///     for await quake in QuakeMonitor.quakes {
///         print("Quake: \(quake.date)")
///     }
///     print("Stream finished.")
