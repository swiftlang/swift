import Swift

/// An ordered, asynchronously generated sequence of elements.
///
/// AsyncStream is an interface type to adapt from code producing values to an
/// asynchronous context iterating them. This is intended to be used to allow
/// callback or delegation based APIs to participate with async/await.
///
/// When values are produced from a non async/await source there is a
/// consideration that must be made on behavioral characteristics of how that
/// production of values interacts with the iteration. AsyncStream offers a
/// initialization strategy that provides a method of yielding values into
/// iteration.
///
/// AsyncStream can be initialized with the option to buffer to a given limit.
/// The default value for this limit is Int.max. The buffering is only for
/// values that have yet to be consumed by iteration. Values can be yielded in
/// case to the continuation passed into the build closure. That continuation
/// is Sendable, in that it is intended to be used from concurrent contexts
/// external to the iteration of the AsyncStream.
///
/// A trivial use case producing values from a detached task would work as such:
///
///     let digits = AsyncStream(Int.self) { continuation in
///       detach {
///         for digit in 0..<10 {
///           continuation.yield(digit)
///         }
///         continuation.finish()
///       }
///     }
///
///     for await digit in digits {
///       print(digit)
///     }
///
