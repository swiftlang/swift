// ==== DiscardingTaskGroup ---------------------------------------------------

/// Starts a new scope that can contain a dynamic number of child tasks.
///
/// Unlike a ``TaskGroup``, the child tasks as well as their results are
/// discarded as soon as the tasks complete. This prevents the discarding
/// task group from accumulating many results waiting to be consumed, and is
/// best applied in situations where the result of a child task is some form
/// of side-effect.
///
/// A group waits for all of its child tasks
/// to complete before it returns. Even cancelled tasks must run until
/// completion before this function returns.
/// Cancelled child tasks cooperatively react to cancellation and attempt
/// to return as early as possible.
/// After this function returns, the task group is always empty.
///
/// It is not possible to explicitly await completion of child-tasks,
/// however the group will automatically await *all* child task completions
/// before returning from this function:
///
/// ```
/// await withDiscardingTaskGroup(...) { group in
///   group.addTask { /* slow-task */ }
///   // slow-task executes...
/// }
/// // guaranteed that slow-task has completed and the group is empty & destroyed
/// ```
///
/// Task Group Cancellation
/// =======================
///
/// You can cancel a task group and all of its child tasks
/// by calling the ``TaskGroup/cancelAll()`` method on the task group,
/// or by canceling the task in which the group is running.
///
/// If you call `addTask(priority:operation:)` to create a new task in a canceled group,
/// that task is immediately canceled after creation.
/// Alternatively, you can call `asyncUnlessCancelled(priority:operation:)`,
/// which doesn't create the task if the group has already been canceled.
/// Choosing between these two functions
/// lets you control how to react to cancellation within a group:
/// some child tasks need to run regardless of cancellation,
/// but other tasks are better not even being created
/// when you know they can't produce useful results.
///
/// Because the tasks you add to a group with this method are nonthrowing,
/// those tasks can't respond to cancellation by throwing `CancellationError`.
/// The tasks must handle cancellation in some other way,
/// such as returning the work completed so far, returning an empty result, or returning `nil`.
/// For tasks that need to handle cancellation by throwing an error,
/// use the `withThrowingDiscardingTaskGroup(returning:body:)` method instead.
///

/// Tasks added to a task group execute concurrently, and may be scheduled in

/// - when ``cancelAll()`` is invoked on it,
/// - when the ``Task`` running this task group is cancelled.
///
/// Since a `DiscardingTaskGroup` is a structured concurrency primitive, cancellation is
/// automatically propagated through all of its child-tasks (and their child
/// tasks).
///
/// A cancelled task group can still keep adding tasks, however they will start
/// being immediately cancelled, and may act accordingly to this. To avoid adding
/// new tasks to an already cancelled task group, use ``addTaskUnlessCancelled(priority:body:)``
/// rather than the plain ``addTask(priority:body:)`` which adds tasks unconditionally.

/// ========================================
///
/// Since it is not possible to explicitly await individual task completions,

///

///   group.addTask { try boom() }
///   try await group.next() // re-throws "boom"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Since discarding task groups don't have access to `next()`, this pattern
/// cannot be used.
/// Instead,
/// a *throwing discarding task group implicitly cancels itself whenever any
/// of its child tasks throws*.
///
/// The *first error* thrown inside such task group
/// is then retained and thrown
/// out of the `withThrowingDiscardingTaskGroup` method when it returns.
///
/// ```

/// }
/// ```
///
/// Generally, this suits the typical use cases of a
/// discarding task group well, however, if you want to prevent specific
/// errors from canceling the group you can catch them inside the child
/// task's body like this:
///
/// ```
/// try await withThrowingDiscardingTaskGroup { group in
///   group.addTask {
///     do {
///       try boom(1)
///     } catch is HarmlessError {
