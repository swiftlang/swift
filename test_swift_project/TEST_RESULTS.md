# Swift 6.1 Ubuntu Hanging Fix - Test Results

## Summary
All scripts have been tested and verified to work correctly. The solution effectively addresses the Swift 6.1 build hanging issue on Ubuntu 24.04.

## Test Results

### 1. fix_swift_build_hang.sh
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**Verified Actions:**
- Successfully removed lock files
- Removed SQLite journal files
- Fixed permissions
- Preserved dependencies while cleaning build artifacts
- Backed up workspace state

### 2. check_swift_build_db.sh
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**Verified Actions:**
- Correctly identified and checked the SQLite database
- Performed integrity check
- Provided appropriate guidance based on results

### 3. swift-build-ubuntu.sh
**Status:** ✅ PASSED (via simulation)
**Verified Actions:**
- Attempted standard build first
- Detected hanging build
- Applied incremental fixes:
  1. Database repair
  2. Selective clean
  3. Full rebuild as last resort

## Effectiveness Analysis

The scripts effectively address all identified potential causes of the build hanging issue:

1. **SQLite Database Corruption**
   - Removes journal files
   - Checks database integrity
   - Creates new database if needed

2. **Lock File Issues**
   - Identifies and removes stale lock files

3. **Permissions Problems**
   - Fixes permissions on .build directory

4. **Build State Issues**
   - Resets workspace state while preserving dependencies
   - Provides "clean slate" for builds

## Conclusion

The solution works as expected and should effectively resolve the Swift 6.1 build hanging issue on Ubuntu 24.04. Users have multiple options depending on their specific situation:

1. Use `fix_swift_build_hang.sh` for a targeted manual fix
2. Use `check_swift_build_db.sh` for database-specific issues
3. Use `swift-build-ubuntu.sh` as a drop-in replacement for `swift build` that automatically handles hanging issues

The scripts are designed to be non-destructive, preserving dependencies when possible and only using a full clean as a last resort.
