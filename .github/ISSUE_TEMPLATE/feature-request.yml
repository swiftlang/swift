        This repository hosts the Swift compiler, the Swift standard library,
        the Swift runtime, SourceKit, and IDE support for the Swift language.
        It does *not* track feedback on Xcode and other closed source Apple
        developer software such as SwiftUI and UIKit; please direct it to
        [Feedback Assistant](https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting)
        instead.

        Swift is guided by a community-driven process referred to as the
        [Swift evolution](https://www.swift.org/swift-evolution)
        process. Submitting this form is not a guarantee that the request will
        be considered or implemented. If the request implies an addition,
        removal, or change to the features of the Swift language or the public
        interface of the Swift standard library, please consider socializing it
        on the
        [Swift forums](https://forums.swift.org/c/evolution/discuss)
        instead. The Swift forums are the preferred space for sharing ideas and
        discussing them with the Swift community.

        Describe the problems that this idea seeks to address. If the
        problem is that some common pattern is currently hard to express, show
        how one can currently get a similar effect and describe its drawbacks.
        If it's completely new functionality that cannot be emulated, motivate
        why this new functionality would help create better Swift code or
        developer tools.
