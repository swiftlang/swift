        This repository hosts the Swift compiler, the Swift standard library,
        the Swift runtime, SourceKit, and IDE support for the Swift language.
        It does *not* track feedback on Xcode and other closed source Apple
        developer software such as SwiftUI and UIKit; please direct it to
        [Feedback Assistant](https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting)
        instead.

      label: Description
      description: >
        A concise description of what causes the problem, in human language.
        Though not required, it may help us to more accurately triage the issue
        as well as understand a non-trivial test case.

      label: Reproduction
      description: >
        Provide a test case, preferably in a Markdown code block, and explain
        how to build or run it to reproduce the problem.
        If the problem is a poor or unexpected diagnostic, fix-it, or other
        output, please show this output as is.
        For example, paste it from the terminal.
        Consider reducing the test case to the smallest amount of code
        possible â€” a smaller test case is easier to reason about and more
        appealing to contributors.
